The cycle proceeds as follows:  A trader makes an initial trade with a base amount. If the trader makes a win on an initial trade, the trader cashes in on the win and the cycle ends. However, if the trader makes a loss on an initial trade, the cycle continues in the following manner: the trader includes the following formula in his next trade: (the value of the loss) + (the value of the previous trade) + (the value of the previous trade - the return being offered by the broker). The trader utilizes this formula as many times as the trades finish with a loss. At the point when the trade makes a win, the trader cashes in on the win and this cycle ends. Each win denotes the end of a cycle, the trader withdraws the win and starts the cycle anew. With every cycle, the trader starts again with the base amount. The upside of this strategy is that trader can offset all loses by further trading until a win occurs, providing the necessary funds are available. The downside of this strategy is that funds can run out before a win occurs and the trader can lose everything."

With this strategy, the trader analyses a graph showing the performance of any specific asset and identifies 1 of 3 trends. These trends are the upward trend, the downward trend, and the neutral trend. If an asset is identified with an upwards trend, the trader predicts that the asset will go up. If an asset is identified with a downward trend, the trader predicts that the asset will go down. If an asset is identified with a neutral trend, the trader avoids trading because it is very difficult to predict in which direction the asset's value is likely to go."

The reason for using a strategy is to maximize your wins and minimize your loses, but strategies are not infallible. Therefore it is the trader who is always responsible for the trade and not the strategy. The trader should always maintain control and exercise appropriate caution in trading. Working through all the trading strategies on the internet is neither practical nor even preferable, however the intention of this article is to explain these four strategies which are applicable to binary options trading."

Support levels indicate a point at which traders are more likely to buy a stock; whereas resistance levels indicate a stage at which traders are most likely to sell a stock. When such trend lines are broken, supply and demand is also thought to have shifted, which in turn creates new levels of support and resistance. These levels are closely tied with round numbers such as 50, 100, 150 or 200. As prices begin to fall towards a round number, such as $50, investors are more likely to buy large amounts of stock because it’s unlikely prices will drop further. When prices begin to rise towards a round number, investors are most likely to sell a stock."

If a price strongly surpasses resistance, then that level becomes support. This can occur frequently with major publicly traded companies, contrary to the belief of many investors. Being aware of all factors relating to support and resistance helps traders to identify levels that have been tested many times, but never broken. In the event that a stock has tested a support level many times, but never gone below it, a trader may decide to take profits as the security moves towards the point because it’s unlikely it will drop any further. All traders using technical analysis need to monitor such levels at all times because as long as shares remain between support and resistance then a trend will likely continue."

For example, if a price moves above resistance in an upward trending channel, then it has accelerated, not reversed. Avoid placing trades at such volatile points because it’s likely they’ll change rapidly once more. If you do feel confident placing trades very close to support and resistance, then at least make sure to never place trades directly at support or resistance levels. This is because prices often approach whole numbers, but rarely pass them. For instance if you’re bullish on a stock that is approaching support, do not place a trade directly at support. Instead, place your trade above support by a few points."

With this strategy, the trader analyses a graph showing the performance of any specific asset and identifies 1 of 3 trends. These trends are the upward trend, the downward trend, and the neutral trend. If an asset is identified with an upwards trend, the trader predicts that the asset will go up. If an asset is identified with a downward trend, the trader predicts that the asset will go down. If an asset is identified with a neutral trend, the trader avoids trading because it is very difficult to predict in which direction the asset's value is likely to go."

To streamline analysis, moving averages are used as a way to represent the average price of a security over a period of time. By mapping a security’s average price, fluctuations become clearer along with a trendline. Moving averages are thus used to identify trends, trend reversals and to set support and resistance levels. They are also used to determine uptrends and downtrends depending on the direction of the moving average. There are numerous moving averages, but the main types include simple moving average, linear weighted average and exponential moving average."

                      "text": "<p>Last Thursday, June 27, the British public voted in a popular referendum to leave the European Union. The immediate result of the vote was uncertainty in the political, economic, and financial spheres. The EU is the world's largest, and longest running, practical experiment in international political and economic union, and there is simply no precedent for understanding the impact of one country's decision to cut those ties.</p><p align=\"left\">Political polling leading up to the vote showed that the \"Remain\" camp had a small lead in a tight race; the actual vote result was 51.9% to leave and 48.9% to stay, a 3.8 point margin in favor of the Britain's exit. When that result broke in the news, financial markets went crazy.</p><p align=\"left\">The pound sterling lost more than 10% against the US dollar, falling from a pre-vote level of $1.49 to $1.34 today. Sterling's losses were across the board; the pound fell against all of the major currencies. The Euro also fell, but not as dramatically, from $1.13 to $1.11. The drops in both currencies were predicted by analysts before the vote, in the event of \"Leave\" winning; neither drop is surprising, as the Britain's choice guarantees that a wide variety of trade, commerce, customs, and currency exchange agreements will have to be renegotiated or reworked in the near future, perhaps as early as next fall, when the UK government invokes Article 50 the Maastricht Treaty and extricates itself from the EU. The changes in those treaties will affect all economies and currencies with exposure to them, and this past week's market gyrations were a panicked reaction of traders to the anticipation of greater uncertainty to come.</p><p align=\"left\">The major European currencies were not the only ones to make such shifts in the last few days. Where the pound fell against all of the majors, the US dollar gained against most, benefitting from investors flight from sterling and the Euro. The one currency that the dollar did not gain against was the yen, itself a traditional safe haven asset. The Japanese currency has gained nearly 4% against the dollar, and the USD/JPY pair is not at 102.80, the yen's strongest showing in two years.</p><p align=\"left\">Currency markets don't exist in a vacuum. They are interconnected with commodity and stock markets, forming a financial trading network that resembles a spider web more than a set of ladders. Touch one part, and the whole web shakes. Stocks dropped sharply after the vote, but some indexes have since regained the whole of their losses. Gold, the most traditional of tradition haven assets, rose $60 to trade at $1,319.80 per ounce, and the stronger dollar helped to push the price of oil down 6%, although crude has since made up most of that drop.</p><p align=\"left\">The immediate market shockwaves of the Brexit vote are likely fading. The British are glad that sterling hasn't fallen further, the Eurozone sees the Euro as stable for now, and the Japanese have decided that their exporters can live with the yen at 102 to the dollar. The summer will likely be more stable than the last 10 days, and market fundamentals will no longer be overwhelmed by singular political events. The next big items on the calendar: the US election in November, and, as mentioned above, Britain's execution of the exit at about the same time.</p>"

These documents are usually carefully parsed by investors looking for clues as to the Fed's future monetary policy. Consensus this time is not to expect much enlightenment. The FOMC met just a week after a historically poor jobs report, so their decision to hold steady was no surprise. All the minutes can do is confirm that, and possibly add that they don't think it's wise to hike any time soon. Markets already assume that, however, and futures traders put the odds of a rate hike this month at zero, prior to the November election at a mere 6%, and as far out as February 2017 at only 14%.</p><p>So much for last December's vaunted \"Fed liftoff,\" when they switched from a low rate policy to a policy of monetary tightening.<br />The bigger news will come regarding the labor market in the States. On Thursday we'll see two data sets: the weekly initial jobless claims, which give a running tally of the number of newly unemployed seeking benefits; and the ADP payroll report. The first is subject to high fluctuations and tends to lag actual conditions. The second is more important.</p><p>ADP is the USA's largest private payroll process, meaning they calculate and issue payroll checks for employers large and small throughout the country. Every month they release their compiled payroll data to the public. These data releases show, among other things, the total number of jobs in the US and the increase or decrease from the month prior. The monthly ADP report is usually taken as a preview of the Big Event, release on the first Friday of every month.</p><p>That Big Event is the NFP, or Non-Farm Payroll report. This is the detailed report, released by the US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, giving the official details on the labor market situation in the US. The headline numbers of this report are the total number of jobs created and the official unemployment rate. Both numbers are usually simultaneously taken as holy writ and with a very large grain of salt.</p><p>They're the official numbers from the US government, and so the pundits and policy makers tend to see them as the accurate snapshot of the current jobs situation. At the same time, it's a case of \"everybody knows\" that the Bureau of Labor Statistics carefully manipulates the numbers before releasing them, and that the media will just as carefully decide which part of the report to emphasize in the news coverage. The true data &ndash; and news &ndash; is usually buried deeper in the report and surfaces a one to three days after the official release date, when analysts have had time to read and digest the full document.</p>"

                      "text": "<p>Friday will see the US Department of Labor release the June Non-Farm Payroll report. The report, compiled by the Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is seen as the definitive rundown of the labor market in the United States. The upcoming report's greatest impact will almost certainly be felt in the two headline numbers of \"jobs created\" and \"official unemployment,\" the full report will be carefully parsed for clues as to the health of the US economy and the prospects for financial market investors.</p><p>It's important to note here that last month's NFP, reporting the May numbers, was a disaster. The top number showed only 38,000 jobs created during the month, far below the consensus forecast at the time for 168,000, and while the unemployment rate did tick down that as due entirely to a large decrease in the labor force participation rate. In short, May's numbers were awful and investors, as well as policy makers, are dreading a repeat.</p><p>So what can we expect?</p><p>The general consensus regarding the upcoming jobs report is that between 175,000 and 200,000 jobs were created in June. This consensus number is exactly what is needed for the US economy to keep up with population growth &ndash; a jobs gain of that magnitude will show that the economy is growing, but not expanding, at the same rate as the population. It would be a big improvement, however, over the 38,000 jobs in May and the downwardly revised 123,000 in April. It is also more than double the 81,000 average from March to May.</p><p>The upcoming report is complicated, however, by some statistical factors. First, was the relatively low response rate to the BLS' May survey. That could have artificially depressed the total jobs numbers. Second, is the return of 30,000 Verizon telecomm workers to their jobs. These workers were striking at the time that the last NFP was compiled and their absence from the workforce may have been significant. With both of these factors returning to \"normal,\" the June numbers may end up looking inflated next to May.</p><p>Data and statistical fluctuations of this sort are why the BLS also reports longer-term averages. March, April, and May, however, showed a three-month rolling average of only 81,000 jobs; this was partly a reflection of the poor May report but also a reflection of decreases in March and April. So much discussion was focused on the poor May numbers that analysts may have lost sight of the fact that May was third month in a row that the NFP had missed expectations. In fact, May was the eighth month of the last twelve that the month-over-month jobs growth was reported as negative. In addition, while the 12-month jobs average is 200,000, the 6-month average is 170,000, showing that the numbers have been falling off recently.</p><p>While the NFP focuses on the jobs market, it is frequently taken as a proxy report for the general health of the US economy as a whole. Investors use it to gauge their exposure to risk assets and need for haven assets; policy makers use it as an indicator policy efficacy. In each case, prognosticators try to determine what the report might say, and how it will impact future market prices and economic/monetary policy. In this respect, the divergence between the report's actual numbers and the consensus forecast can be as important as the actual data released.</p>"

The answer to that might depend on whether or not you're a shareholder in Nintendo, Inc.</p><p>The game maker had its name on the wildly popular new Pokemon Go app, which has players getting up and going outside to locate, capture, and trade the eponymous pocket monster characters. An app that popular has got to be a cash cow for someone, and Nintendo's stock skyrocketed after the July 6 release. At the top of the jump, share prices reached $193 and the company added $7.5 billion to its total capitalization in just five days.</p><p>What goes up, must come down, and share prices are no exception. On Friday, the company announced that, due to its minority shareholder status in the relevant holding companies, the success of Pokemon Go will have only a \"limited\" impact on Nintendo's bottom line. With quarterly earnings reports looming, Nintendo refused to revise its earnings expectations upwards.</p><p>The immediate result was an investor pullback from Nintendo &ndash; to the tune of 18% coming off the share price. The rout likely would have been larger, but trading rules in Tokyo's equity markets take shares out of circulation if they fluctuate more than 18% in one day. In currency terms, every share lost about 5000 yen - $47 at current exchange rates. It was Nintendo's worst stock rout in 26 years.</p><p>The outlook for the company, however, is hardly as grim as the sharp drop in share price may indicate. Nintendo's shares are still 60% higher than they were before the app release, and as stock and industry analysts have noted, the company's \"limited\" exposure to the success of Pokemon Go comes from its 32% stake in the Pokemon holding company, owner of the successful franchise.</p><p>Yep, Nintendo owns one dollar out of every three that Pokemon brings in, and that's a limited stake. Would you mind a 32% stake in anything as big as Pokemon?<br />Nintendo also owns &ndash; although the total holdings remain undisclosed &ndash; a piece of Niantic, Inc., the Google spin-off that actually developed Pokemon Go. It's another finger in the pot, of the \"limited\" impact.</p><p>So what will that impact actually be? We should have a better idea shortly, when Nintendo delivers its earnings report. So far, expectations are for substantial increase in profits, to 35 billion yen from 16.5 billion last year. Estimates range as high as 60 billion yen. Pokemon Go in contributing strongly to the upside, despite Nintendo's \"limited\" stake. The only downside is the stronger yen, which has a tendency to reduce earnings from outside Japan.</p><p>It's a strange move from Nintendo, making this statement. It's not like the nature of the company's take from the Pokemon profits is a secret &ndash; it's all there in the public record. This may be a case of the company working to downplay one piece of good news (the earnings report) in an effort to increase the benefit (the expected share price increase after the earnings report is released), and traders simply overreacting. We&rsquo;ll see what happens when all the numbers are in.</p><p>And the trader's lesson in all of this? It's not so much, buy Nintendo, as it is, \"Look for what isn't said in the press release.\" A company's statements are sometimes designed to generate a reaction as much as they are to disseminate information. Don't be fooled.</p>"

                      "text": "<p>A rate increase has been an important subject for discussion during the whole 2016 year. Since last December, when Federal Reserve pushed rates a quarter percent higher, everyone concerned with the state of the global economy has lived in expectation of the next rate hike. Various reasons for and against rate increases have constantly been put forward by economists; various occasions have been proposed as the most likely date for implementing the Federal Reserve’s intentions. Even now, three months before the end of the calendar year and two month before the Presidential Election in the U.S, monetary policy makers and economists are still wondering whether to wait or not wait for a rate hike, never closer to finding a definite answer to this question.</p><p>Great Britain’s decision to part company with the European Union made the debates over the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies even more heated. Before the vote, the majority of analysts estimated a rate increase as almost inevitable, saying that it would happen at least once in 2016. Immediately after Brexit’s victory, the probability of a rate hike was reduced to zero. Everyone thought in June that Britain’s separation from the European Union would wreak havoc with economy and markets and would create an atmosphere highly unfavourable to any changes in rates. Yet Britain’s vote proved to be less dramatic and troublesome in reality than it had been imagined. No crisis ensued in the world; and no sooner the shock caused by the vote had subsided, the British economy began to show signs of resilience. The British market never collapsed. The British pound, though still low, has never been rendered worthless as was feared.</p><p>When everyone understood that Britain’s exit from the European Union did not lead to turmoil, the odds that Fed policymakers would boost rates in 2016 significantly grew. Within a few months, the possibility of a rate hike this year moved up from 8 percent to 30 percent and, immediately after Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s speech, climbed to whooping 60.2 percent. The closer the world approached the date of the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole summit, the more confident some analysts and traders became about the inevitability of a rate increase. On the twenty fifth of August, however, Janet Yellen failed to sound unequivocal about this inevitability. She optimistically praised the current state of the labour market and expressed hopes in the further economic growth of the country. Yet vague about the possible dates of rates increase, Professor Yellen left her listeners no more enlightened than they had been before her speech. In effect, she said in Jackson Hole what everyone suspected all along: that a rate increase could happen before the year’s end. The anxiety that everyone felt during the biggest part of 2016, therefore, continues to overwhelm analysts and investors even now.</p><p>Other analysts from the Federal Reserve Committee tried to fill in the gaps that Janet Yellen left in her speech. Like the Federal Reserve Chairwoman, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer also praised the solid performance of labour market and added that August job reports would influence their decision whether to push rates higher and when to do so. Other voting members of FOMC chimed in with Mr Fischer’s opinion and speculated that, probably, September 20-21, at which the Federal Reserve Committee is scheduled to meet, would be the right time to increase rates. Since Janet Yellen had given her speech in Jackson Hole, several significant events occurred but did not shed more light on the time of the next rates hike. The August job reports came out and, instead of confirming everyone in their opinion that rates would be pushed up, strengthened the uncertainty surrounding the issue. August job reports were painfully disappointing; and however enthusiastically everyone tried to put the insufficient creation of jobs down to the notoriety of the month August, during which little happens at the job market, low numbers – only 151,000 jobs created instead of 180,000 predicted by economists – eloquently pointed to an economy that was ailing. Despite the forecast that the unemployment rate would drop to 4.8%, it stubbornly remained at 4.9%. Wage growth, too, showed itself weaker than everyone expected. The disappointing job report again only confused everyone instead of enlightening with regard to the time of rate increase.</p><p>The meeting of the Federal Reserve Committee is approaching in a few days. The world is again breathlessly waiting for a remarkable rate hike, wondering whether the Federal Reserve will risk increasing rates before the Presidential Election in November or will put doing this off until December, as some analysts foresee. It well may be that in a few days the anxiety that everyone feels over Feds’ decision will not subside but will continue overwhelming the world. It well may be that 2016 will be written in history as the year not only in which the forty fifth U.S. president was elected but also in which Federal Reserve kept economists and investors continuously on edge never clearly revealing its plans concerning rates increase.</p>"

The leader of the PVV, Geert Wilders had promised a referendum on the question of whether the Netherlands will remain part of the EU or leave the EU. The reelection of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, combined with the poorer than expected performance of the PVV, created greater certainty in the minds of investors about the future of the Netherlands remaining part the Euro and the EU.</p>"

The withdrawal is commonly known as Brexit and expected to be completed in 2019. The UK is the largest trading partner of the Republic of Ireland and USD 1.3 billion worth of goods and services criss-cross the border between the Irish Republic and the UK every week. This trade supports an estimated 200,000 Irish jobs. The Republic of Ireland is the 5th largest market for British exports. Currently there are no tariffs on this trade because both the Republic of Ireland and the UK are automatically part of a customs union as a direct result of both countries being members of the EU. When the UK leaves the EU, the current customs union situation between the Republic and the UK will automatically come to an end unless a trade deal is otherwise negotiated as part of the Brexit process.

As a result of Brexit there is a move in Northern Ireland to create a special EU status whereby the current situation of people and commerce moving freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland can continue. If this move is not successful, there is a good chance that Northern Ireland would hold a referendum about becoming part of the Republic of Ireland or remaining part of the UK. If Northern Ireland were to become part of the Republic of Ireland, it would automatically become part of the EU because the Republic of Ireland is an EU member country. As a result of the bilateral Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland between the UK and Republic of Ireland in the late 1990s, the people of Northern Ireland have the right to hold a plebiscite to determine their own future; remaining part of the UK or to becoming part of the Irish Republic are the choices at the heart of that future.</p>"

As a country with a low corporate tax rate, a similar legal system to the UK, and its status as the only English speaking country that will be left in the EU after Brexit, many multinational companies, especially companies in the hi-tech, banking, and financial services industries are expected to look at Irish cities such as Dublin as a launching pad into the European market and a place to set up European headquarters. Such a move would come at the expense of London. How much it would impact London is another open question, as even with the Brexit London remains the world's second largest financial centre.</p>"

Investors were not inclined to make drastic moves, and trading was largely uneventful. The Dow Jones Industrials shed 0.3% for the day and 1.1% since the previous Friday. The S&P also lost 0.3% on the day and dipped 1.2% for the week. The NASDAQ retreated 0.9% on Friday and dropped 1.9% from a week ago. In Europe, trading was more vigorous, despite investors’ worries over the suspension of the Brexit campaign caused by the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, who was supportive of the decision to stay in next week’s referendum. The FTSE soared 1.2% on Friday but slid 1.5% from a week ago. The DAX advanced 0.8% and declined 2.1% overall on the week. The SMI jumped 1.0% on the day and, like other indices, slumped 2.6% since the previous Friday. Stocks in the Asia-Pacific region continued climbing on Friday helped by the rising oil prices and weakening yen."

A former Bank of Japan official has stated that if the market turbulence proves temporary, and the yen gives back some of its gains, than the central bank can hold off on another stimulus effort. The statement added that Japan reserves the right to intervene in the currency markets to prevent the yen from appreciating too much, as a stronger yen is a severe drag on Japan's export dominated economy. Such a move would be strongly opposed by Washington, and market watchers are skeptical that Tokyo would follow through. The BoJ next meets to review rates and monetary policy at the end of July, but there is speculation that the bank will hold an emergency session sooner."

These two currencies have the most intimate exposure to the looming Brexit, and it remains to be seen how they will stabilize.<br/>The US dollar index, the broad measure of the greenback used to get a big-picture look at the currency's standing, has dipped to 95.976, a bit below Monday's peak of 96.544 but still two full points above its pre-referendum level.<br/>Accounting for normal variability, the index shows a broadly stronger dollar which has gained as investors pulled their money out of the UK and the Eurozone and put into perceived safer assets.</p><p>The other currency that gained from the Brexit vote was the Japanese yen, which has also traditionally been used as a safe haven. The yen is now near 2-year highs against the dollar, as the USD/JPY is trading at 102.39. It actually touched 99 on Friday, but has eased back and it may be that the yen is the first major to find a post-Brexit trading level. If so, it won't make the Japanese happy, as their export-dominated economy prefers a weaker yen.</p>"

Crude dropped initially after the vote, getting down to the $47 handle yesterday, but has now rebounded. US West Texas Intermediate is trading for $48.53 per barrel and Brent is up to $49.21.</p><p>The higher prices come as the American Petroleum Institute showed US stocks declining by nearly 3.9 million barrels, including a 1.2 million barrel drop at the States' largest oil storage and distribution facility in Cushing, Oklahoma. Another boost to crude came from Norway, where 7500 oil and gas workers in one of Europe's largest oil producers are threatening to go strike starting Saturday, over a new wage and labor deal.</p><p>It's important to remember that these factors, as well as other recent news that pushed oil up slightly, are only partly compensating for the underlying weak market fundamentals that have been impacting oil trading. OPEC and Russia are still producing at record levels; US fracking and shale producers have grown more efficient in the face of lower prices and learned how to maintain production while reducing the number of active rigs; global storage facilities are still near record levels; demand is weak in major consumers such as China; and the International Energy Agency is predicting a global oversupply averaging 1.5 million barrels per day looking ahead through 2017. In short, nothing has changed among the basic reasons why oil prices fell in the first place. Look for continued volatility in the oil markets.</p><p>The real winner in the post-Brexit market chaos has been gold. The metal is near a two-year high, despite easing back after reaching $1,362 last Friday. Gold is currently trading at $1,321.15 per ounce, putting it up about 25% for the year to date. Haven asset demand has fueled the metal's gains.</p><p>Silver has also gained, for the same reasons and almost as dramatically. It's selling at $18.31 per ounce, also a two-year high. Platinum, which like silver has industrial demand that has been swamped by asset trading, is now going for $989.20.</p>"

The metal touched a high last Friday, at $1,360 per ounce, and has since pulled back to $1,315.65. Even accounting for that, gold is still $60 higher than before the Brexit vote, making a gain of 4.5%. Overall, gold has appreciated more than 20% since January 1, making this its best first half in more than ten years.</p><p>Silver and platinum have also made gains. Silver is trading at $18.41 per ounce, and is challenging the $18.50 level. Some analysts expect that it will break that resistance in the near future and possibly climb as high as $25. Platinum has broken above $1,000 for the first time since June 9, and is now trading at $1,007.55.<br />Oil declined in trading right after the British results came in, falling to the $47 handle, but has since regained the lost value. Crude picked up nearly 4% overnight as investor fears over the Brexit have eased and a combination of data releases and news reports have eased worries over supply issues. Currently, the US West Texas Intermediate benchmark price stands at $49.41 per barrel and the global markets' Brent price is at an even $50.</p><p>On the supply side, the official US report on oil inventories showed that crude stocks fell by 4.1 million barrels last week, beating early expectations by a wide margin. In addition, talks between the Nigerian government and guerillas in the Niger Delta are showing signs of success which may portend a resumption of Nigerian oil production and export.</p><p>It's important to remember that despite the positive news regarding supply, there is still a tremendous oversupply in global oil markets. Worldwide, production is exceeding demand by about 1 million barrels per day, and oil storage facilities around the world are nearing their maximum capacity. In the US, oil inventories total 526.6 million barrels, an 80-year high level for this time of year. Despite day-to-day or week-to-week fluctuations, this is the basic supply and demand issue that is dominating oil markets right now and holding prices down.</p>"

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 is up 0.48% and the TOPIX has gained 0.41%. The rally here comes despite a poor industrial production report, which showed May's output plunging 2.3%. Japanese stocks may be reflecting an adjustment to the now-stronger yen, an acceptance of its new level in the 102 range, and an easing of fears that the currency could strengthen further. The Japanese markets are highly sensitive to exports, which are negatively impacted when the yen appreciates.</p><p>In China, the CSI 300 index managed to squeak out a 0.14% gain for the day, while the Hang Seng picked up 1.74%. Australia's Sj&P ASX gained 1.70%. It's important to remember that even though the Asian markets have posted gains over the last several days, they are all still down significantly for the month of June.</p><p>From the US, there have been some mixed economic reports. Housing data missed expectations with a 3.7% decline in pending home sales, and the April data was revised downwards. Personal spending, however, showed a rise in May of 0.4% and April's number was revised upward slightly to 1.1%.

The New York markets will be closed on Monday for the July 4 holiday, a happy Independence Day to our friends in the US.</p><p>European and Asian markets also finished well last week. London's FTSE 100 gained 1.13%, the DAX picked up 0.99%, and the CAC 40 added 0.86%. Spain's IBEX 35 advanced 1.29%.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific, the Nikkei 225 added 0.68% and the TOPIX gained 0.69%. These were welcome developments for the Japanese, as the now-stronger yen is likely to have a depressing effect on exports which in turn will tend to push Tokyo's equity markets down.

At least, in theory.

Happy Independence Day to our friends in the States!<br />In Europe, market watchers are focused on the Italian banking sector. The major Italian banks are basically insolvent, weighed down by an enormous backlog of bad loans, and unable to continue operations without a bailout. Italy's historical method of dealing with a situation like this was to devalue the currency, bail out the banks, and let everyone deal with the new exchange rate. That option is not available in the Euro regime.</p><p>The problem, however, is that after the Greek debacle, northern European countries are in no mood to permit any further bailouts. Greece was the world's 44th largest economy, and bailing them out nearly tore apart the Eurozone. Italy is the world's 8th largest economy. Europe hasn't got the resources to make this bailout happen, even if the political will did exist.</p><p>In the meantime, in the UK, the Bank of England's Governor has hinted that the central bank may push a monetary stimulus policy over the summer, to deal with the Brexit fallout.</p><p>The European markets reflected the gloom, with FTSE in London losing 0.84%, the DAX falling 0.69%, and the CAC 40 dropping 0.91%.<br />In the Asia-Pacific markets, Australia made the headlines. The Reserve Bank of Australia announced its decision to hold interest rates steady at their record low of 1.75%. The Bank's board cited the ongoing market volatility as well as the Parliamentary issues after the indecisive Aussie Federal elections. Economic data releases from Down Under were not bad, showing a 1% rise in exports and 0.2% gain in retail sales for the month of May.</p><p>In the stock markets, Tokyo reflected the stronger yen with a 0.66% drop in the Nikkei 225.

The Aussie is also higher, at 0.7518, the USD/CHF has edged down to 0.9749, and the USD/CAD retreated to 1.2956. The US dollar index, the broader measure of the dollar against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, slipped 0.2% to 96.013.</p><p>The pound and the yen made bigger news. The pound dipped to another 31-year low, actually getting below the $1.28 level before bumping back up to its current $1.2982. Sterling's drop comes as investors are dropping the currency on fears that Britain, and then Europe, could tip into recession during the upcoming implantation of the Brexit. The British currency has taken the harder hit, falling 15% since the referendum.</p><p>While the dollar gained strength on the weakness the pound and Euro, the yen saw stronger gains. The Japanese currency has appreciated some 5% against the dollar, getting a boost from its role as a safe haven asset. The yen's reputation comes from Japan's institutional stability, but ironically its gains tend to undermine its haven asset role by depressing Japanese exports and then consequently hurting Japanese equities. Right now, the USD/JPY is trading at 100.76, and trending downwards. The yen has not been this strong since November of 2013 &ndash; 31 months ago.</p><p>It's important to note that the yen has been appreciating for the last six months. For the first half of this year, global economies have been showing signs of slowing, and investors have been seeking haven assets. The yen, as well as gold, has strengthened on that sentiment, and Japanese policy makers are having difficulty countering it.</p>"

The inventory draws as the summer driving season in the US reaches its height, increasing demand for petroleum products. The drawdown report came from the trade group American Petroleum Institute, and showed a reduction of 6.7 million barrels.</p><p>The downward pressures on oil prices haven't relented, however. Stockpiles of refined products remain high, and slowing economic growth with its tempered demand for oil has weighed on traders. In light of this, Brent crude is selling for $48.89 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate is going for $47.57.</p><p>Precious metals are up, gaining on their reputation as haven assets while investors are pulling out of riskier instruments such as oil and equities. Gold rose slightly overnight and now stands at $1,366.55 per ounce. Silver and platinum both gained yesterday but eased slightly as trading began today.

Bank stocks are feeling serious pressure, as the German banking giant Deutsche Bank is scrambling for funds to avoid insolvency, Credit Suisse's share price has hit an all-time low, and the Italian banks are in even worse shape, with 17% of their outstanding loans being non-performing. A full blown banking crisis is taking shape in Europe, and it's only a matter of time before it can no longer be kicked down the road.</p><p>Right now, the FTSE in London is up 1.18%, the DAX is up 0.80%, and the CAC 40 is up 1.03%. Yesterday, they lost 1.2%, 1.7%, and 1.9% respectively. It will likely be an interesting day for the European equity markets.</p><p>As today's session comes to an end in the Asia-Pacific region, the major indexes are decidedly mixed. Tokyo is down, and no surprise given the yen's appreciation and Japan's sensitivity to exports. The Nikkei 225 lost 0.67% and the TOPIX fell 0.66%. China's CSI 300 rose towards the end of trading, but still finished with a loss of 0.21%. The Hang Seng, however, put up a gain of 1.07%. Australia's Sj&P ASX also gained, 0.59%.</p><p>In New York, the US markets opened to losses yesterday but rallied posted gains by session's end. The DJIA gained 0.44%, the Sj&P 500 advanced 0.54%, and the NASDAQ was up by 0.75%. These gains came despite a data release showing that the US trade deficit increased to $41.14 billion in May, well over the expectation for $40 billion. The widening trade deficit can be traced to the dollar's recent gains making US exports more expensive overseas.</p><p>Investors had a chance to look over the Fed's June FOMC minutes, and the futures traders lowered the odds of an interest rate hike before December to just 12%. That's down from 44% before the Brexit vote. It may be that they are being generous; a casual glance a calendar should make it obvious that there will be no further rate hike this year; with the election coming up in November, the Fed will not move until the next Administration is sworn in.</p>"

All three metals are higher than they were before the release of the jobs report.</p><p>Copper, an important industrial metal and a useful proxy for the industrial metals market, continue to slide and is now down to $2.12 per pound.<br />Oil prices are also falling, with the drops mainly driven by continued worries about supply and demand &ndash; global supplies remain high while demand is only moderate, and on a global level daily production is exceeding demand by about 1 million barrels. It's a situation made for low prices.</p><p>It's not helped any by the OPEC cartel's deliberate strategy of overproduction in pursuit of market share despite lower prices. Saudi Arabia &ndash; the largest producer and exporter in OPEC &ndash; initiated the strategy about two years ago, with several objectives in mind. They were looking to push high cost North American shale and tar sand producers out of business; they were looking to increase Asian and North American market share; they were meeting the production challenge posed by Russia; and they hoped that low prices would put pressure on their geopolitical rival in Iran. To a large extent, the Saudis have achieved these goals.</p><p>It's an interesting background to an oil market in which crude is once again approaching the $45 mark. Overall, prices this year have paralleled the pattern we saw last year, with an increase in spring, a plateau in June, and drop in July. It remains to be seen in that parallel will hold.<br />At the end of last week's trading, Brent crude was selling for $46.76 per barrel and WTI was going for $45.41.</p>"

The report was widely anticipated, as last month's jobs numbers were nothing less than atrocious.</p><p>The June numbers were better, far better. At 287,000 jobs created, the report exceeded expectations by more than 100,000 and showed the highest monthly increase since last October.</p><p>One point of caution in lauding the numbers: May's already bad result was revised further downwards, to just 11,000, and the three month moving average, even with the excellent June print, is only 147,000, actually lower than this time last year.</p><p>The unemployment rate edged up slightly, as did the labor force participation rate. A close look at the demographics of the jobs gains shows that 90% of all the new jobs went to workers over age 55. This may be a sign that aging workers are deferring retirement, or that employers are seeking experience first. In either case, it's a hard blow to younger workers.</p><p>Markets liked the news, however, and the overall impression of a growing US jobs market. The Dow gained 1.40%, the S&amp;P 500 picked up 1.53%, and the NASDAQ advanced 1.64%.</p><p>In Europe, there was also a positive reaction, with the FTSE 100 showing a pickup of 0.87%, the DAX gaining 2.24%, and the CAC 40 showing a rise of 1.77%.<br />Asian markets had closed before the release, and showed losses. The Japanese markets were especially hard hit, as the stronger yen weighed on them. The Nikkei 225 lost 1.11% and the TOPIX fell 1.32%. The Hang Seng lost 0.69% and the CSI 300 in Shanghai dropped 0.55%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX managed to squeak out a gain of 0.05%.</p>"

PM Abe's win there raises the chance that Japan may see additional stimulus measures. The USD/JPY is currently trading at 101.95.

Sterling appeared to have stabilized a bit recently, however, and the currency actually edged up overnight. Those gains are gone now, and the GBP/USD has slipped again to 1.2884.

Such a policy would also depress the pound. Right now, the FTSE 100 is up in early trading, with a gain of 0.49%. The DAX is up 1.27%, and the CAC 40 has gained 1.08%.</p><p>US markets are not open yet, but got a boost on Friday from the strong June jobs report. The report showed a gain of 287,000 jobs created for the month, but it also revised the May numbers down to an anemic 11,000. Taken together, the May and June reports show that the economy was performing at its average rate for the last 6 months, and the wide divergence between the reports is likely a statistical fluke.</p><p>Market traders remain unconvinced that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again this year, despite the jobs situation, and have priced in only a 24% chance of a rate hike by December. A glance at the US election calendar, however, should convince anyone that 24% is far too high &ndash; Janet Yellen is not likely to take any move that could unbalance the November elections. Don't expect a rate hike this year.</p><p>In the meantime, the Dow finished Friday up 1.40%, the S&amp;P 500 finished up 1.53%, and the NASDAQ gained 1.64%.</p>"

In Tokyo, the weaker yen also helped, and the Nikkei 225 rose 2.46%. The TOPIX also rose, showing a gain of 2.38%. Investors are more sanguine of Japanese markets now that PM Abe has a clearer path toward implementing his 10 trillion yen stimulus package.</p><p>In China, the CSI 300 index rose 1.46% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.94%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX joined in the general gains, and posted an increase of 0.30%.<br />European markets ended well yesterday, after the British Tories chose Theresa May, currently the Home Secretary, to the Conservative Party leadership. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to step down in coming days, at which point the Queen will formally ask May, the new majority leader in the Commons, to form a government. May is widely expected to maintain the UK's cordial trade relations with the EU as she navigates the complicated procedure for pulling Britain out of the single market.</p><p>Both the pound and the Euro rose on news of her planned succession. It's a rare instance of most parties being pleased by a result &ndash; \"Remain\" supporters know that she is in favor of close ties with the EU, while \"Leave\" supporters know that she'll invoke the exit clauses of the Maastrict Treaty.</p><p>Markets reflected the happy feelings. In London, the FTSE closed 1.40% higher, the DAX gained 2.12%, and the CAC 40 advanced 1.76%.<br />In the US, Wall Street saw some record closing. The S&amp;P 500 set an intraday record high during the session, and closed with a gain of 0.34%. The Dow gained 0.44%, and the NASDAQ picked up 0.64%.</p><p>Market watchers are feeling sanguine after the strong June jobs report, and are pricing in increased odds &ndash; at 30% &ndash; of a Fed rate hike by December this year.

Crude was just above $50 earlier this month, but is facing significant pressure from supply and demand issues &ndash; specifically, the global supply glut that just won't go away is crossing demand that just won't increase as much as expected.</p><p>The supply side issues are more immediate. The American Petroleum Institute's estimate that US stockpiles expanded by 2.2 million barrels last week hasn't helped prices any, nor has the International Energy Agency's admission that oversupply is pushing down prices and that May inventories, worldwide, increased by more than 13 million barrels to a record high of 3.074 billion. The IEA expects inventories to continue rising in June, including oil stored on tankers at sea.</p><p>Price-wise, all of this has Brent at $47.72 per barrel, while the US benchmark WTI is selling for $46.20.</p><p>Oil is generally considered a risk asset. Gold, on the other hand, is used as a safe haven by investors when riskier assets are showing too much volatility. Gold tends to advance when other markets go haywire, and to drop on news of stability.</p><p>Gold took such a hit yesterday, falling to two-week lows on the news about Theresa May's planned succession to 10 Downing Street. Gold fell as low as $1,330 before ticking back up to $1,340.90, for a recoup of about half the total loss. The yellow metal is still up about 27% for the year to date.</p><p>Silver has also done well, and is selling for $20.43 per ounce. Silver has important industrial uses that gold lacks, so it is instructive to compare it with copper. Copper has also gained, reaching $2.24 per pound, for a 4% gain this week.</p>"

That rally is showing signs of a slowdown. In their most recent sessions, both the American and Asian indexes, while they closed with daily gains, showed the same pattern of starting high and falling during the trading day. European stocks are opening to mixed results and volatility in today's session.</p><p>In the US, part of the pushback comes from the Federal Reserve, whose members have been hinting that despite the strong June jobs report the Fed will not likely rush to raise rates. The hints, while they had a market impact, were not exactly unanticipated; traders put the likelihood of a rate hike this year at less than 50%. Many analysts, including this writer, believe that the US election cycle effectively precludes any rate hike before February of next year.</p><p>Taking a look at the market numbers, the Dow Jones gained 0.66% yesterday, while the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ both gained 0.70%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up by 0.84% in today's trading, the Hang Seng had gained 0.46%, and the CSI 300 in Shanghai was up 0.30%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX gained 0.66%.</p><p>The UK decision to leave the EU fed uncertainty in the markets, but with the selection of Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed to the Premiership, things seem to be calming down in Britain. May has supported the Remain camp, but is on record saying, after the vote, that \"Brexit means Brexit.\" She is expected to take a slow and cautious course while invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty.</p><p>In the meantime, European investors are wary today, and markets are volatile. The FTSE 100 in London has been up and down; it is currently up 0.07%. The DAX has fallen 0.08%, and the CAC 40 is up 0.19%.</p><p>Market traders will be watching May's selection for Chancellor of the Exchequer, the British finance minister, for clues as to how she will trigger the mechanics of the Brexit.</p>"

It's an ominous sign of weak demand in the busy summer driving season.</p><p>In another sign of the ongoing supply glut, nine major oil tankers are simply sitting in the North Sea, keeping some 9 million barrels of crude in \"floating storage.\" This is up 2 million barrels from May, and is only a drop in the 95 million barrel bucket of crude oil stored on tankers at sea worldwide. It's the highest volume stored this way since the 2009 recession.</p><p>Perhaps a bigger problem than just the volume of crude oil at sea is that most of the floating cargoes are not on contract &ndash; they haven't got buyers yet. With demand softening in Europe and China, that situation is not likely to change.</p><p>What all of this means for traders is the likelihood of lower prices for at least the near future, despite today's slight uptick.

The Dow Jones showed a modest increase of 0.13% yesterday, while the S&amp;P 500 was nearly flat with a gain of just 0.01%. The NASDAQ slipped slightly, by 0.34%. Trading has been more volatile in New York recently.</p>"

According to futures markets, the odds of such a hike have increased to 38%. Other analysts, however, believe that 38% is too sanguine, as the US election is coming up. The electoral cycle effectively precludes any Fed action before November, and simple inertial makes it unlikely that there will be any further monetary policy changes &ndash; easing or tightening &ndash; before the next Presidential Administration is sworn in at the end of January.</p><p>In the meantime, the US stock markets will face another test this coming week with the regular release of Q2 company earnings reports. Investors will be watching closely for evidence of the Brexit vote's impact on the bottom line.</p><p>In the UK, the Bank of England kept key rates steady last week at 0.5%, taking a cautious path in the wake of the Brexit vote. The BoE did hind that it could act at its next meeting in August &ndash; a string of conditional tense verbiage there &ndash; but will decide when the data from the next Quarterly Inflation Report become available.</p><p>With the background there, a look at market numbers shows mixed results last Friday.

Gold got a heavy boost from the Brexit referendum in the UK, rising from $1,256 reaching a peak price of $1,366 on July 8.</p><p>Despite recent losses, which have brought the metal down to a price of $1,329.03 per ounce, gold is up about 25% for the year to date. It is receiving ongoing support from low expectation that the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again this year and from increasing expectations that central banks in the UK, EU, and Japan will embark on another round of monetary easing. Both factors increase the appeal of gold as a store of value.</p><p>Silver, which also made big gains after the Brexit vote, has also slipped in recent days. It is now selling for $19.97 per ounce and trending downwards.</p><p>Oil markets have seen a number of developments recently. Oil prices gained slightly after news of the Turkish army's coup attempt, but only slightly. Turkey is not a major oil producer; rather, it is a conduit for other Middle Eastern countries' energy, and the quick defeat of the coup, combined with the Turkish government's need for an income stream, promised stability and reliability in the flow of oil and oil products through Turkey.</p><p>The bigger factors affecting crude oil prices are the usual ones: supply and demand. Gasoline inventories in the US are reaching max storage capacity, and recently five tankers full of fuel have been turned away from New York harbor; they could not unload because there was nowhere to put the gasoline. It's the summer driving season in the US, normally the time of peak demand for gasoline, but so far that demand has been weak and has not dented the oversupply.</p><p>The oversupply of gasoline will impact demand for crude oil, as refiners will have less need for crude to work with, especially with US crude oil stocks also near record levels. The oversupply has industry analysts predicting that crude oil prices could dip back to $40 per barrel.</p><p>Additional bad news for oil bulls comes from the supply side. There were a number of supply disruption this spring and early summer, but those events are clearing up. The wildfires that temporarily shut down the Alberta oil sands are out, and Canada's production is returning to normal. Nigeria has resumed output after coming to an agreement with militants in the Niger Delta, and Libya has said that the state oil company may be able to increase exports later this month. Finally, OPEC's core Gulf nations are producing oil at record levels. With storage facilities full, and global supply exceeding demand, it is not an environment that encourages a long-term rise in prices.</p><p>With that as the background, we see that Brent crude, the global trading benchmark, is at $47.69, while the US benchmark, WTI, is selling for $45.98 per barrel.</p>"

Silver and platinum are also both down, selling for $19.41 and $1,082.84 respectively.</p><p>Copper, a purely industrial metal with wide applications in everything from home construction to consumer electronics to jewelry, has ticked up slightly to $2.26 per pound.<br />Oil prices are edging up today, mostly on news from the States showing a drawdown of 2.342 million barrels of crude oil in the nation's storage facilities. The same report, however, also showed some ominous factors for oil bulls going forward: a buildup in gasoline stocks of more than 900,000 barrels, and build (within the overall drawdown of stocks) at the Cushing storage facility of almost 190,000 barrels of crude. The Cushing facility is the US' largest oil storage depot, and it is already near its maximum capacity. A storage overflow there will reverberate throughout the North American oil industry.</p><p>In the markets, Brent crude is currently selling for $47.54 per barrel. The US benchmark WTI is showing more volatility, and is currently priced at $44.94. The gasoline and Cushing builds are weighing heavily on the US oil price, as is weak demand for the summer driving season.

In the wake of these events, industrial and material companies suffered most in the US. In Europe, it is travel companies who took the biggest plunge on Thursday thanks to the poor reports from EasyJet and Lufthansa. In the Asia-Pacific region, trading was influenced by investors’ worries about the falling yen and the increasing oil prices. The most of indices dropped.

At Friday's close, gold finished the week down 0.26%, marking its second consecutive weekly loss. Gold hasn't had two weeks in a row of losses since May.</p><p>Despite the recent losses, gold is still above $1,300. It's currently selling for $1,316.35 per ounce, and is up about 24% for the year-to-date. The metal has been boosted by lower expectations for a US Federal Reserve rate hike and by concerns over global economic conditions.</p><p>Silver and platinum have been showing similar price patterns, and are also down from recent highs. Silver is trading for $19.57 per ounce, down from its peak above $20 but still up 41% for the year. Platinum is selling for $1,074.75, a gain of 20% year-to-date.</p><p>We've been talking in the space for a while about oil market supply and demand issues. This may sound basic, and it is, but it has been the main driver for prices for some time. Simply put, due to overproduction on a tremendous scale there has been a supply glut in the markets for nearly two years now. A supply glut of that magnitude cannot help but push prices down, especially when shaky global economic conditions are keeping demand modest at best.</p><p>However, it is the summer driving season in the US, and higher demand, combined with production cuts spurred by lower prices, finally started making a dent in the US crude oil stockpiles. There has been hope among oil traders that the supply draws and lower production together could start pushing prices back up. There may be a brief bump to that effect, but don't bet too much on it. Demand is about to fall.</p><p>Oil demand in the US is seasonal, and August/September are typically low-demand months. People are returning from vacations, and driving less. In response, refineries use less oil. And it's important to note that while overall US crude supplies have drawn down somewhat, US gasoline inventories have actually risen, due to weak demand even for the driving season. Expect the refiners to start their maintenance cycle early this year.</p><p>So much for the demand side. On the production side, the OPEC countries have been making up for the States' slack with a production increase to 32.9 million barrels per day in June. Russia, the largest non-OPEC supplier, is expected to increase output by nearly 600,000 barrels per day by 2019, and even in the States there are signs that production may increase soon. US drillers have brought an additional 41 rigs online in the last month.</p><p>With that background, the slipping oil prices start to make more sense. US crude, the WTI benchmark price, is down to $44.04 per barrel and Brent, the global trading benchmark, has fallen to $45.58 per barrel. Both prices are trending downwards.</p>"

Telecom and utility companies helped drive the market gains, with Q2 earnings reports that exceeded the forecasts. Yahoo and Verizon were both among the winners, with share prices advancing on leaked news that Verizon would offer $5 billion to purchase Yahoo. Both companies declined to comment on the news.</p><p>Recent upbeat economic reports have also buoyed US markets. The reports showed US economic reliance in the face of global conditions that are flat or flashing red. The June jobs reports, retail sales numbers, and a measure of the service industries have all beaten the forecasts. One positive result of this: investors are more sanguine now that the Federal Reserve will indeed raise interest rates again before the end of the year. The Fed will meet this month, and while traders have only priced in less than a 10% chance of hike now, they put the odds by December at 45%. A glance at the US election cycle calendar should be enough to disabuse anyone of that notion, however; the election is on November 8, and the new Presidential Administration will take office on January 20. Don't expect the Fed to act before February.</p><p>In Asia, the main markets were mixed. Tokyo's markets dipped slightly, while Chinese and Australian markets rose. The Nikkei 225 showed a drop of 0.04%, while the TOPIX dipped 0.16%. In Shanghai, the CSI 300 gained 0.18% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.13%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX added 0.64%.</p><p>Nintendo seems to have been the biggest weight on Tokyo's stocks. The game company lost 18% after it announced that his has only a limited stake in the wildly popular Pokemon Go app, and that the financial impact of the app on the company's bottom line would be modest.

Continued concern over supply and demand issues is pushing crude down in the markets.</p><p>Simply put, supply is rising while demand is weak. WTI prices are facing pressure from a rising count of active rigs in the US, foreboding an increase in supply, at the same time that weak demand has led to an increase in gasoline stockpiles despite the summer peak driving season. Brent prices are pressured by high OPEC production, and the prospect of increased exports from Iraq and Libya. On top of all of this, demand is slowing in Asia as China's economy starts to sputter.

Hints in Fed chair Janet Yellen's statement seem to indicate that the bank will pursue a slow and gradual pace in monetary tightening.</p><p>Wall Street's markets dropped after the statement. At yesterday's close, the Dow was just into negative territory, with a loss of 0.01% and the S&amp;P 500 had lost 0.12%. The NASDAQ also dipped after Yellen spoke, but remained in the green with a 0.58% gain for the day.</p><p>Looking at some individual stocks, Apple rose more than 6% on news of better than expected iPhone sales. Twitter fell sharply, losing almost 15% on poor revenue forecasts, and Coca-Cola fell more than 3% on poor sales reports.</p><p>In Europe, markets are opening lower after posting gains yesterday. The FTSE 100 in London is down 0.04% and the DAX is down 0.16%. The CAC 40 has bucked the trend, and gained 0.19%.</p>"

Silver, also a traditional form of money and a haven asset, saw smaller gains, rising to $20.39 per ounce. Silver has gained over 9% for the month of July.</p><p>The big winner among the precious metals, however, was platinum, which jumped to $1,148.58 per ounce. The white metal has important industrial uses (in the catalytic converters that help control car emissions), is sensitive to ongoing labor disputes in South Africa, and has also gained as a haven from central banks' monetary easing. Platinum is up 28% for the year, giving it a slight edge over gold in terms of return on investment.</p><p>Oil, on the other hand, is moving the other direction, and has lost nearly 20% since the beginning of June. This puts the fuel on the path to an official bear market.</p><p>Supply and demand issues have dominated the oil markets lately, and even though much excess production is slowing down, global stockpiles are still nearly overflowing. It's estimated that there are more than 3 billion barrels of crude oil in stockpiles around the world.

The headline number of 1.2% was far below expectations; economists has predicted 2.6%, but the actual number was less than half that value. In another hit, the Q1 number was revised down to just 0.8%.</p><p>The next major data release coming up is the July non-farm payroll report, due out on Friday, August 5. The last two NFP releases were opposites &ndash; May's report was disastrously low, while June's report was unbelievably high. The two together matched the six month average. The forecast for July is for 180,000 jobs created, enough to meet the pace of population growth, but the poor GDP growth casts some doubt on that rosy prediction.</p><p>The gloomy news had immediate repercussions. The prospect of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike is now seen as much lower, and the US dollar dropped sharply in the markets.</p><p>US stocks finished Friday with mixed results. The Dow was down 0.13%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.16%, and the NASDAQ picked up 0.14%.</p><p>Bank of Japan also disappointed investors on Friday, when it refused to increase its monetary easing activities with further purchases of Japanese government bonds or by pushing interest rates deeper into negative territory. The BoJ announcement casts doubts, or at least concerns, over how the government plans to fund PM Abe's aggressive 28 trillion yen economic stimulus plan, and has spurred speculation that the central bank will resort to some form of simply printing money &ndash; so-called helicopter money &ndash; and releasing it into the general public.</p><p>Japanese stocks were volatile on Friday, but ended in positive territory, as the Nikkei 225 0.56% and the TOPIX added 1.20%. Australian stocks showed a similar pattern, and the S&amp;P ASX gained a modest 0.10%. In China, however, stocks were down. The Hang Seng lost 1.28%, and on the mainland Shanghai's CSI 300 fell 0.53%.</p><p>In Europe, markets were similarly volatile. London's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 both traded in the red during the session, but finished with gains of 0.05% and 0.44% respectively. The DAX was green all day, and ended 0.61% ahead.</p>"

Oversupply and indications of increasing US and OPEC production are combining to push prices down.</p><p>In the States, the number of active rigs for the fifth week in a row, and the eighth time in the last nine weeks. It's a likely a lagging response to the summer's bounce in oil prices &ndash; drillers sold product on higher futures prices which allows them to increase production despite a price decline now. The higher production, however, cuts into oil prices and that will depress production later.</p><p>Oil stockpiles are also high, underlining fears of global oversupply. Again, looking at the States, crude stocks increased by 1.67 million barrels two weeks ago, and are only slightly off their 97-year high of 543.4 million barrels from April. Petroleum product stocks are also up, as gasoline inventories rose to 241.5 million barrels.</p><p>Brent crude is below $43, selling at $42.98 right now, and WTI, the US benchmark grade, is selling for $41.12 per barrel. Expect the high stockpiles of refined products to keep crude oil demand weak and prices down, at least through the end of the year.</p><p>Gold hit a daily peak above $1,360 on Friday, as haven demand fueled purchases. The demand was spurred by the overall gloomy economic news, the slow growth in the US, and the BoJ decision not to push monetary easing right now. Precious metals all showed gains.</p><p>Right now, gold remains high but has eased slightly to $1,347.91 per ounce. Silver is selling for $20.52, and platinum for $1,147.56.</p>"

Corporate earnings are down worldwide, marking the fifth straight quarter of declines in the US. The slowing global economy is hurting sales figures in many industries, impacting the bottom lines.</p><p>Earnings in the States, with two thirds of the S&amp;P 500 members having reports so far, are down 3.3% from Q2 last year. Asia and Europe are in worse shape. Among companies in Asia that have announced results, earnings are down 19%, while Stoxx Europe 600 members have reported an average 14% decline so far.<br />The gloomy picture isn't relieved by growth forecasts, as the world economy is only predicted to grow by 2.9% this year. It's the lowest growth forecast since 2009. The US, EU, and China are expected to slow down this year, as are major emerging players such as Mexico.</p><p>Among the factors casting shadows on growth forecasts are the British decision to leave the EU, and the upcoming Brexit process; the US Presidential election in November, with widespread dismay at the available choice of candidates; and the increase in global terrorism. It's not a pretty picture.</p><p>The current data are not giving any better impression. In the US, Q2 Gross Domestic Product grew at an anemic 1.2% rate, and the Q1 figure was revised down to 0.8%. The poor GDP growth has put a damper on expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike; futures traders put the chance of an increase by September at just 12%, and have reduced the December chances to 33%.</p><p>The US stock markets responded with a mixed day on Friday, as the Dow lost 0.13%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.16%, and the NASDAQ edged up 0.14%.</p><p>In Asia, news from Japan and China was also disappointing. The Bank of Japan chose not to increase its monetary easing policies &ndash; not to increase government bond purchases or to push interest rates further negative. The decision came after PM Abe's government announced an aggressive economic stimulus package, totally 28 trillion yen and well above the 10 to 20 trillion yen expected. However, only some 7 trillion yen of the stimulus is expected to be direct fiscal measures, so investors are taking a wait and see approach to Japan's future monetary and economic policy.</p><p>In China, meantime, manufacturing data showed more reason for concern about the slowdown in the second largest global economy. The manufacturing PMI dipped to 49.9 for July, showing the first monthly contraction in five months.</p><p>Stock markets in Asia reacted to the news with mixed results. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 gained, advancing 0.40%, while the TOPIX fell 0.07%. China's CSI 300 index lost 0.85%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.09%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX gained 0.45%.</p><p>Turning to Europe, investors are waiting for Thursday's Bank of England policy decision announcement. BoE is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points &ndash; the first cut since 2009 &ndash; but not to increase bond buying.</p><p>The European equity markets opened to gains today, but have dipped since. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.04% and the CAC 40 has fallen 0.42%. The DAX is still up, by 0.29%.</p>"

Tesla offered $2.6 billion in stock for SolarCity, which is more than its first offer of $2.5 billion made a month ago. Verizon made a deal to purchase Fleetmatics Group, a maker of software for vehicle fleets, for $2.4 billion. As a result of the deal, Verizon decreased. Shares of Fleetmatics Group, by contrast, gained. Ionis Pharmaceuticals advanced thanks to a good development of its new drug for spinal muscular atrophy in infants. Having admitted that it would sell its social and mobile games business for $4.4 billion, Caesars Entertainment rose.  </p><p>European Market. In the wake of the release of the EU stress test, banks jumped. The test revealed that Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Austria's Raiffeisen, Allied Irish Banks, and Spain's Banco Popular were the weakest. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank were also among the losers, as were Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, and HSBC. RWE and E.ON slipped, and Air Liquide in France did, too. Veolia Environment, water and waste utility, gained. Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole also finished the trading day in the red. Petrofac rose in London. GlaxoSmithKline jumped as well, having revealed its desire to join a unit of Alphabet. Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group, Barratt Developments, and Persimmon had a slide. Anglo American moved into a positive territory. </p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Because of contradictory reports about the Chinese economy, the Shanghai Composite lost 0.9%. The Hang Seng advanced 1.1%. After being in the negative territory at the beginning of the trading day, the Nikkei managed to finish 0.4% higher. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Mizuho Financial and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group jumped, as did Fast Retailing and Softbank. Sony soared, too. Panasonic declined. In Australia, the S&P/ASX added 0.4%. The All Ordinaries gained as much. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue Metals Group were up, as were gold miners Newcrest, Regis Resources, and Evolution Mining. The Kospi jumped 0.7%.

The Dow fell 0.49%, the S&amp;P dropped 0.64%, and the NASDAQ lost 0.90%.</p><p>The losses came on the heels of Tuesday's data release showing that June incomes rose less than expected &ndash; only 0.2% &ndash; and that the savings rate fell to a one-year low. The data cast some shadows on the consumer sector of the US economy.</p><p>Tuesday's data, after last Friday's poor GDP print, have helped to push the odds of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike further down, with futures traders putting only a 40% chance of more monetary tightening this year. The gloomy outlook is a major factor behind the dollar's fall in the currency markets over the last few days.</p><p>In Japan, meantime, a lower-than-expected economic stimulus package pushed equities down and the yen up. Last week, PM Abe announced that his government would push a policy of stimulus for the faltering economy; rumors had the total amount of the plan at well over 20 trillion yen. The actual policy announcement this week, however, put the total stimulus at just 7 trillion yen, with only 4.6 trillion in direct government spending.</p><p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were not impressed. In Tokyo, the TOPIX is down 2.17% and the Nikkei 225 has fallen 1.88%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.76%, but on mainland China Shanghai's CSI 300 index managed to squeak out a gain of 0.14%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX is down 1.35%.</p><p>In Europe, markets were down yesterday and are opening to more losses in early trading today. London's FTSE 100 is down 0.02%, the DAX has lost 0.13%, and the CAC 40 has fallen 0.44%. These losses come as major European banks are feeling increased pressure from a combination of undercapitalization and an abundance of underperforming loans. Share prices of Deutsche Bank are down and Credit Suisse is managing to scrape out a small gain after losing more than 4% earlier this week.</p><p>Investors are waiting for Bank of England to release its interest rate decision on Thursday, the second such release since the Brexit vote.

Oil broke back above $40, and WTI, the US benchmark, is trading at $40.82 per barrel. Brent, the global market benchmark, is selling for $42.97.</p><p>The gains come after data showed that US crude and gasoline stockpiles fell last week, in the largest draw since April. Some analysts believe that this may mark a reversal of oil's price decline; however, it's important to note that while US refiners are ordering more crude, and drawing from stockpiles, and that distributors are drawing from gasoline stockpiles, demand is still weak and the refiners are starting early to switch from summer fuels to winter blends. The stockpile draws may just reflect that switch; the winter gasoline blends will be used starting in the fall, and the refiners will find the same bind they are in now: low demand, and large supplies of crude. The result could be continued low prices.</p><p>Gold prices declined yesterday, and continue to fall today, mostly in response to the stronger dollar. The drop marks the end of gold's longest rally in the last two months. The metal currently sells for $1,351.89 per ounce. Silver and platinum also declined, to $20.23 and $1,155.59 respectively.</p><p>Copper, the most ubiquitous industrial metal, also fell, losing nearly 1% and dipping to $2.17 per pound. The drop comes on slowing demand is one of the increasing signs that the global economy is faltering.</p>"

It is also assumed that the bank will restart its quantitative easing program of multi-million pound purchases of government bonds. The decision is expected in light of new indicators that the UK economy is on the edge of recession in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p><p>London's FTSE 100 is down ahead of the announcement, losing 0.17% in the last session. The CAC 40 also fell, by 0.16%, and the DAX posted a gain of 0.26% yesterday. The European markets are opening with modest gains in today's session.</p><p>Bank of Japan also increased stimulus policies recently, although less than expected. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 is up 1.08% and the TOPIX index has gained 0.93%. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, markets are also showing gains. The Hang Seng is up by 0.59%, and on mainland China the CSI 300 has gained 0.24%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX picked up 0.18%. It's interesting to note that the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates in its most recent policy decision.</p><p>Turning to the US markets, a rise in oil prices has helped to boost the major indexes by helping out the energy companies. The Dow Jones finished yesterday with a gain of 0.23%, the S&amp;P 500 picked up 0.31%, and the NASDAQ gained 0.43%.</p><p>Another bit of good news for the US markets came from the ADP payroll report. ADP, the largest private processor of payroll records, released its jobs numbers for July, showing that 179,000 jobs were created for the month. This was a decent print, but taken with the low GDP growth of the last two quarters, and the 140K jobs just needed to keep up with population growth, some analysts are saying that the ADP numbers show an economy treading water. In any case, the ADP print is seen as a preview of the monthly official non-farm payroll report, released by the Department of Labor. The July NFP will be released tomorrow.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Friday's jobs data &ndash; the monthly NFP report &ndash; showed that US employment was strong in July with 255,000 positions added compared to a forecast of 180,000. The headline unemployment rate remained stable at 4.9% and the average hourly wage increased 0.3% &ndash; above the predicted 0.2%.</p><p>It was, for the most part, a good jobs report, and it increased expectations that the US Federal Reserve will initiate another interest rate hike before the end of the year. Odds for a December hike are set at 44%, while September, before the upcoming US election, has only a 15% chance of a Fed move.</p><p>The bullish sentiment sent US stock markets to record high level on Friday. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at new all-time highs of 2,182.87 and 5,221.12 respectively. It was a 0.86% gain for the S&amp;P and a 1.06% gain for the NASDAQ. The Dow closed with a respectable gain of 1.04%.</p><p>Data from Asia further underscores worries about the slowing global economic situation. Japan's current account balance for July came in at 1.65 trillion yen, about half of expectations, even though bank lending was up by 2.1%. China's trade balance beat expectations, with a $52.3 billion dollar surplus, but both exports and imports declined from last year. Exports were down 4.4% and imports down 12.5%, showing that China's trade surplus comes even as trade itself is declining.</p><p>By the numbers, the Asia-Pacific region markets took it all in stride. Equity markets followed Wall Street's Friday lead, and posted gains in today's session. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 2.44% and the TOPIX added 2.00%. In China, the CSI 300 advanced 0.91% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong picked up 1.43%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX increased by 0.74%.</p><p>Turning to Europe, we see inflation fears stating to dominate the economic landscape. Specifically, we see fears that inflation will continue to miss the European Central Bank's 2% target rate. The impact of the Brexit vote has been less than feared, so the issue comes down to growth, which has not been strong enough to create the price and wage pressures needed to generate the target inflation. In addition, the price of oil is falling again as we move toward the end of summer, which also tend to deflate prices.</p><p>With the ECB forecasting only a 0.6% increase in consumer prices, there is increasing speculation that Bank President Mario Draghi will be forced to increase the Eurozone's stimulus measures.</p><p>Traders don't appear to be worried, as European markets are off to a good opening today after a good session last Friday. In early trading so far, the FTSE 100 in London is up 0.42%, the DAX is up 0.72%, and the CAC 40 has increased 0.46%.</p>"

Stockpile inventories rose in the US, while the implications of increased Saudi production sank in with traders.</p><p>Data released by the US Energy Information Administration yesterday showed that oil stockpiles increased by 1.1 million barrels, beating the expectations. In addition, stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma tank farm, the nation's largest storage facility for crude oil, increased to 523.6 million barrels, a seasonal high level that has not been seen in 80 years.</p><p>Also, Saudi Arabia reported record setting oil production in July. Much of that is to meet local demand, as energy consumption in the Middle East is highest in the hot summer months &ndash; gotta have that air conditioning! &ndash; but the Kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter, and there is no doubt that much of that oil will end up on the markets.</p><p>Still, that would just add to the glut in global markets, and there are signs that demand is simply not meeting the supply. The same report that showed US stocks increasing also showed that US refineries were using 255,000 barrel per day less than the previous week, and that US imports fell by 334,000 barrels per day. These drops come at a time when US production is declining from its recent peaks. So there is an apparent slowing demand in the world's largest oil consumer, at the same time that global supply is increasing. It's not an environment conducive to higher prices.</p><p>And in fact, prices are down. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark price, is selling for just $41.51 per barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell below $44, and is now at $43.93.</p><p>Precious metals also fell overnight, although in this case the cause was profit taking after a sharp increase. Gold and silver both lost 0.15%, and platinum dipped 0.02%. All three metals remain at high levels, with gold selling for $1,344.56 per ounce, silver for $20.14, and platinum for $1,176.00.<br />Gold's current price puts it 27% higher for the year. Gold, and the other precious metals, have found support from a variety of fear factors in the markets including the low interest rates in the States, negative rates in Japan and several European countries, and anxiety over the UK's intention to exit the EU. All of this has boosted demand for haven assets. Look for gold to remain strong despite occasional price dips like today's.</p>"

The moves come as Saudi Arabia has been talking up the possibility of discussing production cutbacks &ndash; next month.</p><p>The OPEC nations are scheduled to hold an informal meeting in September, and the kingdom, the organization's largest oil producer and exporter, has signaled its willingness to talk about stabilizing the oil markets. That's a euphemism for boosting prices by cutting back on production. The drawback, of course, is that the Saudis need their current high production levels to maintain market share against rival oil giants Russia and Iran. Saudi Arabia, with its deep pockets and plentiful hard currency reserves, made the decision more than two years ago to keep production high and force prices low in an effort to harm the US shale producers (rivals in the oil business), Russian oil producers (more business rivals), and Iran (geopolitical foe that requires high oil prices to balance the budget). The irony, of course, is that their aggressive policy has gone on too long, and now the low prices are starting to sting the kingdom. In this environment, the Saudis are unlikely to do more than try and talk up prices, as they need their high production levels as much as they need higher sales prices.</p><p>That's not the only mixed signal in the oil markets. Worldwide, refiners are expected to bring their crude use to a record level of 80.6 million barrels per day this quarter, a quantity that may help absorb the record level production from OPEC. The US, however, is the world's largest consumer of crude oil, and stockpiles there &ndash; of crude and refined products like gasoline and diesel &ndash; are rising even as production is edging up. US refineries are entering their slowest production period of the year, when they shut for maintenance and then switch to producing winter blend gasolines.</p><p>Putting all of this into numbers gives us WTI, the US trading benchmark, at $44.66. Brent crude, the global benchmark price, is selling for $47.10. Both are starting to edge down, while remaining up from yesterday.</p><p>Oil isn't the only commodity whose price is moving around. Gold is up 27% for the year to date, but has started to lose steam. This month, the metal has lost about 1% as haven demand slowed after a strong US jobs report. Gold is currently selling for $1,340.55 per ounce. Other precious metals are also down from recent high levels, with silver selling for $19.90 and platinum for $1,129.60 per ounce. All three metals are up slightly from overnight lows.</p>"

Trading was downbeat, but rose in the latter half of the session and all three indexes finished on a rising trend.</p><p>The picture outside of the US isn't so good. Continued lagging economies and poor economic reports have prompted central banks to push further stimulus programs, but the results have been mixed so far.</p><p>The Bank of England raised rates last week, for the first time in seven years, and embarked on a bond-buying program of quantitative easing. They ran into a headwind &ndash; a lack of buyers on the first day. Since then, the Bank has been more successful with its stimulus, and the markets have responded. The FTSE 100 is up in early trading today, with a gain of 0.18%, the DAX is up 0.30%, and the CAC 40 has picked up a more modest 0.08%.</p><p>In Japan, the government is moving to enact a large economic stimulus while the central bank is under pressure to increase monetary easing and negative interest rates to fund the government initiative. At the same time, Q2 economic growth came in at just 0.2%, well below the 0.7% forecast.</p><p>Tokyo's markets were not impressed. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.30% and the TOPIX has lost 0.50% in today's session. These drops come as the yen is strengthened due to weakness in the US dollar. Japanese stocks frequently move in the opposite direction as the yen, as a stronger currency makes Japanese exports more expensive and the Japanese economy is exquisitely export-sensitive.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, stock were up.

There's a lot of equivocation in that sentence, but oil traders are looking for any reason to hope the current low price regime may be drawing to a close.</p><p>Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer, jumped on the bandwagon, too, and hinted that it may go along with Saudi cuts. However, there are no signs that Iran has any plan to cut production; rather, Iran has signaled that it intends to keep increasing crude oil output now that international trade sanctions are lifted.</p><p>In addition to the confusing signals from major producers, market fundamentals of supply and demand still point to lower crude prices. Storage facilities worldwide are near maximum capacity, and demand is relatively weak in both the US and China, the world's largest oil consumers.</p><p>For the moment, though, crude prices are generally up. US benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate is trading at $45.36 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent is at $47.91. Both are trending down right now, on some mild profit taking as traders take advantage of these current prices.</p><p>In the precious metals markets, gold has made gains for two sessions now. The metal had fallen as investors moved toward riskier, higher returning assets, and took profits from the high prices in gold. With the gloomy data releases last week, and the Federal Reserve's policy position unclear, gold is now gaining again. The current price is $1,347.60 per ounce.</p><p>Silver and platinum are also both rising. Silver is now at $20 even, and platinum is selling for $1,123.27.</p><p>Iron ore, which had rallied strongly this year and is now priced at $60 per metric ton, may see a drop as we move toward Northern Hemisphere winter. The colder months typically see a slowdown in iron ore consumption in China, the world's largest user of the metal.

The gain started when Saudi Arabia hinted that it would consider future production cuts at an informal OPEC meeting next month. Crude prices immediately jumped, as traders grasped at any chance for higher returns.</p><p>There's a question in this for oil traders: Why is the Saudi's statement pushing up oil prices?</p><p>The oil market fundaments &ndash; high production, soft demand, and overtaxed storage facilities &ndash; all point toward lower prices. A production cut by Saudi Arabia now will do nothing to alleviate that; the Kingdom is pumping oil at record levels &ndash; an estimated 10.9 million barrels per day this month, versus 10.67 million in July. Saudi Arabia chose to push production up and prices down two years ago, in a conscious effort to expand market share. The lower prices are hurting them, and talking up a cut is their way of trying to boost prices. It's not exactly a new trick, having been successfully applied this past April and June.</p><p>It's a question worth pondering as oil traders have to decide whether crude is really worth what they are paying. Brent is currently selling for $50.88 per barrel, and WTI, the US benchmark, stands at $48.52.</p><p>The US dollar was the only asset hit by the Fed's indecision. Gold has been pushed down by the possibility that the US central bank could raise rates. The metal rallied strongly in the first half of this year, but has slipped in recent trading sessions. It is now selling for $1,341.47 per ounce. Silver and platinum are also down, at $19.31 and $1,114.30 respectively.</p>"

Investors temporized unwilling to make significant moves before the Federal Reserve’s meeting at the end of the week, where new information about a rate increase is expected to be revealed. Falling oil prices also undermined investors’ enthusiasm and deflated their hopes that the crisis with oil oversupply can be diffused. Analysts claim that even if an agreement about the curtailment of oil production is achieved, this would prove to be counterproductive for OPEC, because the agreement might lead to further price gains and an increase of supply from other producers. Investors’ inactivity contributed to markets’ volatility. After having shuttled between gains and losses for the largest part of the trading day, stocks around the world eventually moved to the negative territory. Weakened by falling prices of copper and other metals, mining companies bore the brunt of losses. The US indices were mixed, The Dow Jones industrials declined 0.1%; the S&P lost as much. The NASDAQ closed 0.1% up. On Tuesday morning, the Dow Jones and the NASDAQ remained the same. The S&P was 0.06% down. Similarly mixed were European indices Monday. The FTSE shed 0.4%. The SMI added 0.4%. The CAC retreated 0.2%. The DAX edged 0.5% lower. Tuesday morning, however, brought some improvement to indices in Europe. At the beginning of the day, the FTSE rose 0.52%; the DAX added 0.63%; the CAC advanced 0.61%.</p>"

In the US, trading was invigorated by highly positive consumer reports for July. The data showed that consumer spending, most essential for the economic development of the country, has steadily been growing for the last four months. And even though the same reports simultaneously pointed to an increase in the personal savings rate indicative of the possible reduction of consumer spending in future, investors considered the consumption data to be a good beginning of the third quarter. The US stocks jumped led by banks and other financial companies. Banks appreciated on Monday in the wake of the Fed Reserve’s intention to introduce a rate rise in September. All big banks -- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs - gained. The US indices finished the trading day in the green. The Dow Jones industries rose 0.6%. The S&P advanced 0.5%. The NASDAQ edged 0.3% higher. The European indices fared worse than their American counterparts. The CAC declined 0.4%. The DAX lost as much. The SMI edged 0.2% down. The FTSE was closed for the Bank Holiday. The US dollar continued raising. Crude oil prices continued sinking, brought lower by Iraq’s intention to carry on pumping more oil.</p>"

Platinum edged 0.30% lower to US$1,073.98. Oil is trading slightly higher than last week, when it went even dipper, once investors realised that Saudi Arabia had self-servingly talked up oil prices and Iran would not budge and would not stop pumping.

After he had bought 2.3 million shares, the company advanced 4.52%. Micron Technology also soared, adding 2.42% on Tuesday morning. Allegheny Technologies had a jump of 11.11%.</p><p>European Market. Unlike banks in the US, banks in Europe were planted in the negative territory on Monday. Having agreed to sell its Argentinian subsidiary, Deutsche Bank slipped. Because its chairman was no longer at the supervisory board, Stada, a pharmaceutical company, decreased on Monday but gained 2.12% on early Tuesday. A signed contract with Amtrak to build new high-speed trains helped Alstom’s shares go higher. On Tuesday morning, Alstom was 0.10% up. Because its Zika virus test had been authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration, Roche Holdings advanced 0.33%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Thanks to Janet Yellen’s promise to introduce a rate increase this year and the Bank of Japan’s announcement that stimulus would be expanded, if needed, the dollar-yen pair strengthened. The Nikkei grew 2.3% pushed by the good performance of exporters. Canon, Honda Motor, Toyota, and Mazda Motor were among the winners on Monday. The S&P/ASX tumbled 0.8%. The All Ordinaries lost as much. Banks did as poorly in Asia as they did in Europe. Negatively influenced by sinking prices of gold, Newcrest Mining, Norther Star Resources, and Evolution Mining depreciated. Thanks to falling oil prices and the unsolvable problem with the oil supply, energy stocks took a plunge too. Oil Search, Origin Energy, and Woodside Petroleum were in the red. The Shanghai Composite lost minor 0.28 points. The Hang Seng decreased 0.4%. The Kospi shed 0.3% due to the growing dollar. The Sensex climbed 0.4%.</p>"

Poorly performing technological companies arrested the US market’s upward movement caused by banks’ gains. Investors around the world continued worrying about interest rates, the timing of which increase is still disturbingly uncertain. Friday’s employment report, bound to influence policymakers’ decision, is another event that weighted on investors’ minds. The indices in the US declined. The Dow Jones was lower 0.3%. The S&P retreated 0.2%. The NASDAQ lost as much. In Europe, apart from the British FTSE that edged 0.3% lower, all other indices advanced. The CAC rose 0.8%. The DAX was 1.1% up. The SMI added 0.6%. On Wednesday morning, however, the DAX and the CAC joined the losers, shedding 0.28% and 0.05% respectively. The US dollar was again strong, while the euro showed signs of weakness. Commodities suffered from the strength of the former. European exporters capitalized on the weakness of the latter.</p>"

Both European and Asian markets were again mixed. As it has been the case almost for the whole month of August, trading was lacklustre. Suffering from falling oil prices, energy companies were again in decline. Chemical companies dropped equally low. Disheartened by lack of clarity surrounding a promised rates hike, investors lowered their activities at markets, refusing to make moves before the publication of the employment report on Friday. The persistent problem with oil oversupply continued driving everyone out of humour. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japanese stocks performed well lifted by the weakening yen and unexpectedly optimistic US consumer confidence data. Australian stocks, undermined by the rapid selling of resource shares, limited the upside, however, and pushed the whole market lower.  The Dow Jones industrials shed 0.3% on Wednesday afternoon and remained equally low on Thursday morning. The S&P dropped 0.2% on both days. The NASDAQ sank 0.2% on Wednesday but inched a bit higher on Thursday morning. In August overall, the Dow Jones lost 0.2%. The S&P was 0.1% lower. The NASDAQ was the only index that finished the month in the green, adding 1.0%. On Wednesday, the FTSE declined 0.6% but rallied on Thursday morning, adding 0.31%. The DAX slipped 0.6% on Wednesday but was 0.74% up in the morning on Thursday. The CAC first retreated 0.4% but rose 1.16% on Thursday. The SMI, likewise, had a 0.4% slide on Wednesday.

Exxon Mobil declined 0.43%. Schlumberger followed suit and finished the day 2.03% lower.</p><p>European Market. Due to falling prices of gold, mining stocks continue sinking, as did gold-mining companies. Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Fresnillo, Antofagasta, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Randgold Resources slipped. Banks were again in the green. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank did particularly well on Wednesday on rumours that they might merge. Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, and BNP Paribas also advanced. Barclays, HSBC Holdings, and Lloyds Banking Group soared bolstered by good reports on the healing British economy.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Property stocks jumped and brought the Shanghai Composite up 0.4%. Hang Seng, by contrast, shed 0.2%. In August, the former index was 3.6% higher. The latter advanced 5.0%.

Canon, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Mazda Motor finished the trading session in the positive territory. After the Nikkei had said that Google was going to make a deal with Japan’s largest bank to launch its digital wallet platform, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial soared. Australian indices were in trouble hit by the stronger dollar. Both the S&P/ASX and the All Ordinaries had a 0.8% slide. On Wednesday morning, the S&P/ASX gained a bit but not enough to move out of the negative sphere, being 0.32% lower. For the month of August, both S&P/ASX and the All Ordinaries decreased 2.0%. Even though iron prices started to recover from losses, mining companies retreated. BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals, and Rio Tinto tumbled. Gold-mining companies did too, negatively affected by low prices of gold. Newcrest Mining, Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, and Regis Resources slumbered. The Kospi ended the day 0.2% lower but appreciated 0.9% in August as a whole. The Sensex reached its highest level in more than a year, going 0.4% up on Wednesday.

Trajectories of global markets were different on Thursday. Starting lower, the US stocks managed to gather strength during the day and entered the positive territory by its closure. European stocks moved in a polar opposite direction, starting the day optimistically but declining as trading progressed, negatively influenced by a bad beginning of the trading day in the US. Like European market, the Asian stocks also finished mostly in the red, even though oil prices jumped in the region and China published the best CFLP manufacturing PMI in almost two years -- it jumped to 50.4. In the US, by contrast, manufacturing data was surprisingly poor. Manufacturing activities fell from 52.6 in July to 49.4 in August. Vehicle sales were also disappointing, having dropped from 17.9 million in July to 17.0 million in the last day of summer. Indices in the US inched slightly higher, with the Dow Jones industrial adding 0.1% and with the NASDAQ jumping 0.3%. The S&P did not change. Indices in Europe slid. The FTSE shed 0.5%. The DAX dropped 0.6%. The SMI dipped 0.7%. The CAC remained the same from the day before. IBEX in Spain climbed 0.5%, even though, in all likelihood, Spanish Prime Minister will not be elected for a second term.</p>"

Although these two companies managed to rally on Friday, on Thursday, their shares significantly fell. Both of the companies reported weak sales in August. Salesforce.com boasted good profits but also slipped undermined by its third-quarter guidance. Energy stocks continued slipping, brought lower by falling oil prices. Only material companies were in the green, thereby reining in the market’s downward drifting. Because the Brazilian Oil company Petrobras had announced the premature termination of its contract with Diamond Offshore Drilling, the stocks of the latter sank. Thanks to its good second-quarter reports, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings appreciated. Charter Communications that had recently bought Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks also climbed.</p><p>European Market. After solid gains during the week, banks were mixed. Commerzbank continued appreciating. Deutsche Bank, by contrast, ended the day lower. Thanks to new complaints about its emission testing filed in Australia, Volkswagen lost on Thursday. E.ON dipped, and so did RWE. After it reported a 2.0% rise in full-year profit, Pernod Ricard added 1.57%. Technicolor also advanced. Having placed $650 million convertible bonds due 2023, Inmarsat climbed. Stocks of Hays retreated, after the company warned about the unstable condition of its UK and Irish markets. Low oil prices pulled Royal Dutch Shell and BP down.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. The Shanghai Composite shed 0.7% mainly due to the falling stocks of financial and property developers. The Hang Seng, by contrast, did well on Thursday, adding 0.8%. Thanks to the weak yen, the Nikkei rose, as always helped by exporters. Takeda Pharma, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Alps Electric soared. Just as they did in Europe, energy shares dipped also in the Asia-Pacific region. Inpex had a slide along with Japan Petroleum. Santos and Origin Energy finished in the negative territory as well. Australian indices tumbled. The S&P/ASX dropped 0.3%. The All Ordinaries lost as much. Mining companies retreated, just as energy shares did. Hit by iron ore prices that had sank to their four-week low, Rio Tinto slumped. Banks -- Westpac, NAB, and ANZ -- managed to reap gains. Woolworths also advanced. The Kospi edged 0.1% down. The Sensex was equally low.</p>"

Quite the contrary, the report showed that far less than expected jobs had been created at the job market in August. There was an addition of only 151,000 jobs, which is lesser than 275,000 jobs added in July. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%. Investors, however, shrugged the upsetting news off, explaining the insufficient growth of jobs as seasonally inevitable. August reports traditionally come out weaker than in other months. Poor employment reports failed to drive investors out of humour also because they are expected to prevent Federal Reserve policymakers from pushing rates higher in September. Investors’ nonchalant attitude to the bad job reports became more soar, however, at the beginning of the week, causing the dollar to plummet on Monday. All indices advanced on Friday. American indices appreciated 0.4% on Friday. Since the last week, the Dow Jones industrials soared 0.5%. The S&P also rose 0.5%. The NASDAQ was 0.6% higher for the week. In Europe, all indices also jumped on the last trading day of the week and remained equally high on Monday morning as well. The FTSE soared 2.2%. The CAC appreciated 2.3%. The DAX was 1.4% higher. The SMI climbed 1.9%. Since the previous week, the FTSE rose 0.8%; the CAC added 2.3%. The DAX edged 0.9% higher. The SMI was 1.5% up.</p>"

The US and Asian markets finished the trading session planted in the positive territory, even though the US market vacillated between losses and gains throughout the day. European market was unfavourably influenced by early losses in America. ISM nonmanufacturing report that proved to be disappointing also put investors out of humour and tempered their trading enthusiasm. Investors’ initial optimism about the conversation between Russia and Saudi Arabia gave way to gloominess, once they realized that the two countries would not agree to curb oil production. During their meeting, Saudi Arabia said it sees no need to limit oil output; Russia agreed that a cap is not required. All talks about oil freeze seems to be pure eyewash: oil producing countries continue pumping with undiminished zeal. Iran is already moving closer to achieving the goal of pre-sanctions level production. Russia is producing more than 11 million barrels a day; OPEC countries together are giving 33.69 million barrels a day at present. Affected by the combination of these discouraging data, European stocks declined. The FTSE shed 0.8% on Tuesday afternoon and was 0.03% down in the morning on Wednesday.

Sumitomo Chemical, Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Nippon Suisan Kaisha, and Shiseido advanced on Tuesday, as did also Kyowa Hakko Kirin.

Not expecting rates hike by Federal Reserve in September, investors worried about the economy and the earning power of companies. The Federal Reserve published its Beige Book ahead of its FOMC meeting on the 21st and the 22nd of September. The US economy’s growth was described in it as modest. Wage pressures for highly skilled workers were described as increased; the Beige Book also talked about the difficulty of filling job vacancies for technology specialists, engineers, and construction workers. Consumer spending remained unchanged.</p><p>The US market was brought low by weak data from supermarkets, consumer focused companies, and material companies. The only stocks that closed higher on Wednesday were energy ones, lifted by growing oil crude prices. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 0.1% on Wednesday and was 0.06% lower on Thursday morning. The S&P remained the same, losing 0.33 points on Wednesday and 0.01% early in the morning on Thursday. The NASDAQ was the only index that appreciated both on Wednesday and Thursday, adding 0.2% and 0.15% respectively.  European markets were pressurised by disappointing information about German industrial production. Yet having struggled in the morning, European markets managed to end the trading session in the green. The FTSE added 0.3% on Wednesday and 0.51% on Thursday morning. The DAX and CAC rose 0.6% on Wednesday. The former gained 0.22% and the latter rose 0.24% on Thursday in the morning. The SMI was 0.3% higher.   Asian market was mixed, weakened by volatile oil prices and the firmer yen.</p>"

What helped the US market keep a balance without sliding totally down were energy stocks that rose thanks to growing crude oil prices. After it said that it would drill crude oil in the field in Texas that had been recently discovered, Apache gained. Kroger declined 4.13%. Whole Food Markets slipped 5.28%. Sprouts Farmers Market lost whooping 13.72%. Having showed disappointing sales, Dave & Buster’s Entertainment dipped 2.9%. After Pershing Square had bought 9.9% stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant jumped. Seagate Technology and Western Digital finished the day in the positive territory. American airlines added along with Delta Airlines, United Continental Holdings, and Southwest Airlines. Apple had presented a new iPhone and soared.</p><p>European Market. Due to its negotiations with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile concerning the production of electric vehicles, Volkswagen rose. Other automakers – BMW and Daimler – followed suit and also appreciated. Having said that it had an increase in first-quarter pretax profit, Ashtead Group jumped. Foreseeing low profits this year, Sports Direct International declined. Barratt Developments did as well. Just Eat lost 0.65%. Thanks to growing oil prices, BP and Royal Dutch Shell closed higher. Influenced by investors’ worries about Brexit’s effects on the European economy, Berkley Group retreated.</p><p>Asian Market. The Shanghai Composite stayed the same, adding minor 1.22 points. The Hang Seng shed 0.2%, negatively affected by the report showing that China’s foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.19 trillion in August. Because the yen went up, the Nikkei slid 0.45%. For the same reason, exporters dropped. Sharp, Panasonic, and Mazda Motor drifted lower on Wednesday. Inpex, Fast Retailing, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial dipped. Rakuten, excited to join the Nikkei, soared.  In Australia, things looked up for indices. The S&P/ASX added 0.2%. The All Ordinaries advanced as much. The big four banks jumped. Wesfarmers gained, and so did Myer Holdings. Thanks to rising gold, goldminers -- Newcrest, Regis Resources, Evolution Mining, and Northern Star Resources – surged. Santos slipped, and so did Fortescue Metals Group. The Kospi shed 0.2%. The Sensex lost as much, prevented from bigger losses by the growing rupee.</p>"

Investors were greatly troubled by the announcements of the probable increase of rates in September made by the Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren and echoed by Dallas Federal President Robert Kaplan. In Europe and Asia, investors’ mood was further worsened by the decision of the European Central Bank to maintain its monetary policy unchanged. Poor economic data from Germany, France, and China also weakened everyone’s optimism about the economic future of the world. North Korea’s statement that it had successfully tested nuclear warhead weighted heavily on investors’ minds, too, triggering geopolitical worries. The decline of oil prices was also upsetting, as were Australian home loan data. The majority of indices tumbled on Friday; all of them were in the red on Monday morning. The Down Jones shed 2.1% on Friday and was 2.2% lower for the week. The S&P slid 2.5% for the day and 2.4% since the last Friday. The NASDAQ retreated 2.5% on Friday and 2.4% for the week. European indices sank equally low. The FTSE slipped 1.2% on Friday and 1.7% on the week. On Monday morning the index dropped 1.3%. The CAC lost 1.1% on Friday and as much from the last week.

Utilities, phone companies, and real estate corporations were at the forefront of losing companies, pulled down by the announcements of probable rates hike in September. Negatively influenced by falling oil prices, oil and gas production companies slipped as well. Drilling companies retreated for the same reason. Diamond Offshore Drilling lost whooping 10.34%. The energy corporation, Williams Companies, shed 3.56%. Transocean, an offshore drilling constructor, sank 6.11%. Shares of SL Green Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust, dropped 4.79%. A&AT finished the trading day also lower, shedding 3.57%. Ventas followed suit and closed lower as well. Among these losers, only Restoration Hardware and Finisar advanced. The former soared 3.09%. Finisar, a manufacturer of optical communication components and subsystems, surged 12.79%.</p><p>European Markets. Due to rumours that it is about to close an agreement with the US Department of Justice to start an investigation of the sale of mortgage-backed securities, Deutsche Bank appreciated. Aiming to buy Monsanto, for which it would need to sell its dermatology business, Bayer, a German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company, had a 2.46% slide. Because it said it would want to buy 75% of Chesapeake’s shares in their shared Barnet Shale Company, Total lost 2.03%. British Burberry finished the trading session in the negative territory. Greene King was also in the red by the day’s closure. Having said that its fiscal pre-tax profit rose, pub chain JD Wetherspoon added on Friday but slid 4.12% on Monday morning. Banks had a good day on Friday: Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and HSBC ended up in the green.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Region. China’s August consumer prices advanced 1.3% for the whole year but were lower than in July, when they advanced 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite lost 0.6 on Friday. Yet it was 0.4% higher since the last week. The Hang Seng advanced 0.8% on Friday and 3.6% on the week. The index, however, declined 2.93% on Monday morning. The Nikkei added insignificant 6.99 points on the day and advanced 0.2% since the last Friday. But it lost 1.73% on Monday in the morning. As was the case in Europe, telephone companies fared badly on Friday. NTT DoCoMo, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Kirin dipped. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Kobe Steel, Nippon Yusen KK, and J Front Retailing, by contrast, soared. In Australia, indices continued losing. The S&P/ASX shed 0.8% on Friday and 0.6% on the week. The All Ordinaries retreated as much on both occasions. Big banks sank. Even though oil prices went down, miners managed to keep in the positive territory on Friday, dropping low, however, in the morning on Monday. BHP Billiton slipped 4.04%. Rio Tinto edged 2.45% lower. Fortescue Metal Group plummeted 5.05%. The Bank of Korea continued having their interest at the lowest possible level of 1.25%, thereby negatively influencing the Kospi index. The announcement of North Korea about the successful trial of a miniaturised nuclear warhead also had a role in pushing the Kospi down. On Friday, the index sank 1.3%, remaining unchanged from the previous week. The Sensex dipped 0.9% on the day and was equally low since the last Friday.</p>"

Crude oil sank 3%, trading below US$45 a barrel, after the International Energy Agency had expressed an opinion that world stockpiles of oil will continue growing in 2017, for the fourth consecutive year. The International Energy Agency foresees that global demand for oil will be only 1.3 barrels a day, which is insufficient to solve the problem with oil glut. The gloomy outlook on oil oversupply immediately brought energy companies down. Banks and phone companies also sank, undermined by investors’ anxiety over rates increase.  The Dow Jones industrials shed 1.4%; the NASDAQ was 1.09% lower. The European indices shuttled between gains and losses during the day but were eventually weakened by the poor performance of the US stocks.

Investors curbed their activities in expectations of policy decisions from several banks forthcoming shortly. Today, the Bank of England is holding a meeting, during which it is expected to make no major changes to its current monetary policy. Investors believe that the Bank of England will continue pursuing monetary easing by maintaining its large asset purchase program and its low interest rates.  Investors’ other concern is the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, which will be announced next week. Everyone predicts that the Bank of Japan will increase negative interest rather than expand asset purchases. What, however, arouses investors’ keenest interest is the meeting of the Federal Reserve held next week. The question that has been bothering everyone since the last December is whether the Federal Reserve is going to push interest rates higher. Anxious about the Federal Reserve’s decision, investors refrained from making significant moves on Wednesday. Sliding oil prices also weighed on their sentiments as they watched shares of energy companies going lower. Investors’ worries were, however, tempered by good performance of technology stocks led by Apple that counterbalanced the US markets’ losses. The markets ended the trading session mixed, therefore: the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P slipped 1.18% and 0.06% respectively and the NASDAQ surged 0.36%.  In Europe, only the FTSE rose 0.12%; other indices dropped. The DAX lost 0.08%; the CAC retreated 0.39%; the SMI declined 0.1%. In Asia, most of the indices sank on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, however, the Hang Seng managed to add 0.86% and the S&P/ASX jumped 0.23% higher.</p>"

Having said that its third quarter profit would be smaller than expected, Nucor, an American producer of steel, dropped 1.46%. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store followed suit and also declined.

Oil prices hit one-month low, trading at US$43.03, and negatively influenced energy companies. The Department of Justice advanced $14 billion claim against the Deutsche Bank. The Deutsche Bank slipped 8.47% and brought the financial sector lower. As the S&P 500 declined 0.4%, the dollar surged, reaching its highest level since July. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee voted against changing its key interest rate. They also left asset purchase level unchanged. Rates are left at 0.25%. The Bank’s asset purchase ceiling remains at £435 billion. The Swiss National Bank also did not introduce any changes into its monetary policy. The key deposit rate remained as it was before, at minus 0.75%. The Swiss National Bank also said that it would continue interfering into the FX market with the aim of preventing the further growing of the Swiss franc. Retail sales data also failed to gladden investors. Retail sales lost 0.3% in August, which is more than everyone expected. August industrial production also declined 0.4%. Apart from indices in the Asia-Pacific region, other indices dipped. Dow Jones industrials shed 0.49%. The S&P 500 had a 0.38% slide. The NASDAQ edged 0.10% lower. The FTSE dropped 0.30%. The DAX tumbled 1.49%. The CAC lost 0.93%. The Asian stocks fared better. The Nikkei appreciated 0.70%. The Hang Seng closed 0.63% higher. The S&P/ASX rose 1.08%.</p>"

Lawson advanced. In Australia, the S&P/ASX added 0.2%. The All Ordinaries gained as much. Mining companies did well. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue Metals Group soared.

Oil rose overnight more than 2% after Venezuela said that oil producing countries, those that belong to OPEC and those that do not, are approaching an agreement about oil production and its output. What investors feared yesterday, namely Libya’s and Nigeria’s vigorous re-entry into the oil market, stopped looking frightening on Monday morning. Renewed conflicts in these regions eloquently show that the flow of oil from these countries would be prevented and is not going to rattle the economic world as drastically as everyone feared. Investors are also looking forward to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Wednesday in hopes that it would substantially change its current monetary policy instead of pushing its rates further down the negative territory. Another event that fastened investors’ attention is the meeting of the Federal Reserve later this week. Although the meeting is eagerly awaited, not many people believe that the Federal Reserve policymakers are going to increase interest rates this time. The recent poll showed that economist estimate the probability of rates rise as one-in-four. Only 6% of economists expect the Federal Reserve to introduce changes. The majority of the people think that the Federal Reserve will wait with a rate hike until December, after the President Election has taken place. After losing badly last week, the majority of stocks climbed on Monday. The commodity-heavy FTSE added 1.27%. The French CAC was 1.30% higher. The DAX advanced 0.83%. Indices in the US also rallied. The Dow Jones Industrials appreciated 0.45%. The S&P 500 gained as much. The NASDAQ rose 0.47%. Asian indices did well, too, save the S&P/ASX that inched 0.04% lower. The Nikkei soared 0.70%.

As economists anticipated, the Federal Reserve did not rise rates. However much it praised the blossoming state of the economy, the Federal Reserve decided to wait for more signs of its strengthening, putting off a rates hike until December or, possibly, until the beginning of the next year. Whether the end of 2016 becomes the right time for rates increase will depend on how the economy, inflation, and markets fare before the presidential election in December. Meanwhile, rates range remains at 0.25% to 0.50%. The vote by FOMC members was 6 to 3. The Federal Reserve’s insistence on the same level of rates gave markets a substantial boost.

                            "text": "<p>Oil remains the major topic for discussion among economists. Its fluctuating prices influence investors’ mood and performance of stocks. On Monday morning, 26 September 2016, oil prices jumped but failed either to gladden investors or bring stocks higher. The reason for the advancement of oil prices stemmed from Saudi Arabia’s offer to cut oil production to January levels so that other countries could follow suit and, thereby, jointly achieve the resolution of the problem with oil glut. Although everyone’s immediate reaction to Saudi Arabia’s plan was renewed optimism over the solution of oil oversupply, reflected in the oil price, which climbed to US$44.84 on Monday morning, investors still understand that Saudi Arabia again might simply be trying to talk oil prices up to its advantage. They also suspect that the Saudis’ recent manoeuvre to advise Iran to curb its oil production in exchange for Saudi Arabia’s agreement to freeze its own is only an attempt to blame the Iranians for the lack of deal afterwards. After they have put blame at the door of the Persians, the Saudis will be able to propose conditions that would suit them the most. Investors are sceptical about the resolution of the problem with oil surplus also because oil is being produced now with increased zeal. More than 800,000 extra barrels per day are being delivered to the global market. Russia started to produce more oil; Libya and Nigeria are also restoring supply earlier disrupted by fighting in their regions.  Despite earlier forecasts that oil oversupply would be reduced in 2016, it will most probably continue being a pressing problem throughout 2017. With these gloomy conclusions on their minds, investors were not cheered up by today’s oil jump. Global stocks were deploringly down in the morning on Monday. Apart from the S&P/ASX that was flat in Australia, other indices dipped, with the Hang Seng leading losses. The Dow Jones sank 0.71%; the S&P 500 shed 0.57%; the NASDAQ declined 0.63%; the FTSE in the UK slipped 0.81%; the DAX dropped 0.92%; the CAC in France decreased 1.10%. Asian stocks tumbled by the most in two weeks, sharing the lowest position with the Indian Sensex. The Hang Seng lost 1.53%. Because the yen added 0.2% on Monday, the Nikkei declined 1.25%.</p>"

Although the majority of people disbelieve that oil surplus can be resolved, a hope was given yesterday by Saudi Arabia that hinted at possible compromise with Iran. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister expressed an opinion that Iran, Libya, and Nigeria should be allowed to produce oil at the maximum reasonable level. The only fly in the ointment offered by the Saudis was their conviction that no compromise will be achieved this time in the Algerian capital. Iranian Oil Minister seconded Saudi Arabia’s opinion by saying that reaching agreement at OPEC talks is not on his country’s immediate agenda. According to the two countries, the earliest when agreement between oil producers might be negotiated is November. Supported by this news, markets rose. European stocks were helped by commodity producers that saved them from a monthly decline. On Wednesday, European market managed to recover from a selloff on Monday, on which banks tumbled. All European banks were in the green today in the morning. Deutsche Bank agreed to sell its UK insurance unit Abbey Life Assurance Co. for 935 million pounds and advanced 3.3%. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, revived by corporate news, moved 1% upwards. Asian markets fared worse than European ones. Futures on Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.4%.

European market recovered from Monday’s drop. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index managed to rally after the past decline and added 0.1%. The major reason for the market’s advancement came from European banks’ ability to pare their losses. Pulled down earlier by a 14 million fine, Deutsche Bank appreciated 3.3%. What helped it to rise was its decision to sell its UK insurance unit Abbey Life Assurance Co. Having agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle National Credit Union Administration claims that it sold faulty securities to US credit unions, Royal Bank of Scotland edged 1.00% up. TUI rose its annual forecast and immediately soared 2.4%. Because Deutsche Post said it would by UK. Mail Group Plc for 242 million pounds, the latter jumped whooping 43%.

                            "text": "<p>Wednesday, 29 September 2016, was the day that uncorked a surprise on the world. Despite expectations of the contrary outcome of OPEC talks, Saudi Arabia suddenly called for cutting oil production yesterday in Algeria. The kingdom’s volte-face was unexpected, since together with Iran, it had repeatedly hinted that no deal concerning oil production was likely. The agreement to curb crude output happens first time since 2008 and is motivated, on Saudi Arabia’s part, by the country’s weakened financial situation.  Saudi Arabia boasts the highest budget deficit among the world’s twenty biggest economies. According to economical predictions, the kingdom will face about 13.5% deficit of gross domestic products in 2017. Its economic growth will be only 1%, in contrast to, say, the economic growth of its regional rival, Iran, whose economic jump this year is estimated as high as 4%.  Anxious about its economy, Saudi Arabia hopes, therefore, that a small reduction of oil output will bring higher oil prices and higher revenues and will thus pay off. Although the deal will be discussed only in November and might prove to be less promising than it appears now, at first blush, global markets rejoiced on the news from the capital of Algeria. Oil prices immediately increased 0.2%, reaching US$47.13 a barrel. This is the biggest jump of oil prices since April. Energy stocks also went up, climbing almost 4% in Asia, and brought all markets higher. Global indices were in the green on Wednesday and Thursday morning. The Dow Jones Industrials added 0.61%; the S&P advanced 0.53%; the NASDAQ closed yesterday 0.24% higher. The FTSE soared 1.02%; the German DAX surged 1.07% higher; the CAC in France advanced 1.41%. Because the yen tumbled 1%, the Nikkei rose 1.39%; the Hang Seng was 0.43% up; the S&P appreciated 1.09%.</p>"

In Europe, investors’ spirits were weighted down also by poor economic data. On Wednesday, the new economic release showed that Eurozone composite PMI dropped from 52.9 in August to 52.6 in September. Eurozone retail sales also slipped 0.1% on the month. The Service PMI dipped from 52.9 in August to 52.6 in September.  US stocks finished in the positive territory on Wednesday afternoon. The Dow Jones rose 0.62%; the S&P 500 appreciated 0.43%; the NASDAQ was 0.50% higher. Energy stocks helped by high oil prices jumped along with steel, railroad, biotechnology, and networking shares. On Thursday, European and Asian stocks did better than a day before. Among European indices, only the FTSE remained in the red on Thursday morning, cutting, however, its losses from 0.6% to 0.04%. Other indices managed to exit negative territory. Having dipped 0.3% on Wednesday, both the DAX and the CAC advanced 0.3% on Thursday morning. The Asian stocks gained, with the Hang Seng reaching its four-weeks high. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index hit the highest level this week, adding 0.4%, thanks to the yen’s decline that lifted Japanese exporting and energy companies. The latter jumped 2% and thus became the best performing stocks among other industrial companies. The yen extended its losses for the eighth day on Thursday, trading at 103.70 per dollar in the morning.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>In Europe, markets on Monday, 10 October 2016, moved mostly to the downside, although some stocks kept steady. Investors refrained from active trading, upset by yesterday disappointing job reports and a decline of oil prices. The US Labour Department announced yesterday that instead of expected 175,000 jobs, there were only 156,000 jobs added in September. To make matters worse, the lion share of newly created jobs are low-paid and belong mostly to clerical and social services sectors. The unemployment rate remained roughly the same as it was in August – 5%. The Federal Reserve, however, still holds an upbeat view of the global economy and seems determined to increase interest rates before the end of the year. Another factor contributing to European stocks’ downside movement was price of oil that slid, because everyone feels sceptical about a resolution of oil glut problem. OPEC hopes that by November 30, all its member will agree on an output reduction, which is proposed to be between 32.50 million and 33.0 million barrels a day. At the moment, OPEC produces 33.6 million barrels a day. Agreeing on oil cut is not an easy feat to achieve, considering all countries’ self-serving interests and political antagonism between some of them. Dropping oil prices negatively influenced energy companies across Europe, which contributed to the markets’ general retreat. The majority of European indices thus depreciated. The EURO STOXX 50 shed 0.24%. France’s CAC slipped 0.67%. The DAX in Germany decreased 0.67%. The FTSE was the only index that finished planted in positive territory, rising 0.63%, because it heavily depends on commodities. Boosted by higher metal prices, mining companies performed well and helped the FTSE index in London climb. Stocks in the Asia-Pacific region fared better than markets in Europe. Chinese markets gained, despite a 2% drop in the property sector. The Australian stocks also jumped, pushed upwards by Telecom Services, Metals and Mining companies, and higher prices of gold. The S&P/ASX finished 0.15% higher. The US markets are closed on Monday in honour of Columbus Day holiday. Markets in Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan are also shut.</p>"

It maintained that America had slow but definitely steady economic growth from August and October.  A labour market is defined as “tight”; growth of salaries is described as “modest.” According to the Beige Book, inflation in the US is mild, retail sales are higher, and consumer spending is mixed. Energy was also characterised positively. In addition, the Beige Book praised the expansion of real estate and the improvement of commercial activities in the country. The bright picture the Beige Book presented to investors cheered them up and brought the majority of stocks higher. Oil eased slightly on profit taking but still was high, as was gold that dipped in comparison to its Wednesday price but remained at a two-week highs on Thursday morning. Both commodities positively influenced the activities at markets around the globe. European market was mixed, weakened by the FTSE’s slide. American and Asian markets, by contrast, were in the positive territory. The Dow Jones rose 0.22%. The S&P 500 was equally high. The NASDAQ edged 0.05% higher. The DAX advanced 0.21%. The CAC inched 0.07% up. Because shares of Travis Perkins that announced the liquidation of nearly 600 jobs in 30 branches tumbled 2.46%, the FTSE ended in the red. Asian markets rose.

Also performing badly, Reynolds American closed 2.07% lower.</p><p>European Market. Investors were focused on the European Central Bank’s announcement, though they expected its monetary policy to remain almost certainly unchanged.

The greatest news was the merger of Australia’s biggest gambling businesses -- Tabcorp Holdings and Tatts Group. Thanks to high prices of gold, gold miners Newcrest Mining and Evolution Mining surged.

Pessimism about the resolution of oil glut problem strengthened among analysts and investors. All these factors conspired to bring oil prices down. Oil sank to a tree-week lows. WTI shed 1.02% to reach US$49.45. Brent Crude declined 0.77% to trade at US$50.40. Because the greenback eased slightly and investors turned their attention to the safe haven, gold jumped to a three-weeks high. It added 0.11% and traded at US$1.275.26.

Despite its current growth, gold is not expected to rise for long, because there is a strong likelihood that the Federal Reserve will increase rates before the end of the year.

What, however, enlivened markets on Thursday, the 27th of October 2016, was the publication of several economic reports arriving from the US. Initial jobless claims this week experienced a decline from the last week’s 261,000 to 258,000. Durable goods orders in September shed 0.1%. The pending home sales index rose by 1.5% to 110.0 in September from 108.4 in August. Economic data coming from the UK also affected investors’ mood, since it showed that the country’s economy grew faster than anyone anticipated, which suggested that interest rates’ decrease in 2017 is highly unlikely. On this news, treasury yields hit its highest level since May. The dollar also advanced against all its major counterparts. Oil rose slightly from a three-week low, because the Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries spoke in favour of curbing oil production. Calling on OPEC members to be flexible, the Saudi Arabia promised to reduce its peak oil output by 4%. Although the Saudi Arabia’s pledge immediately influenced oil prices for the better, it is unclear whether cutting of the Kingdom’s oil production by 4% would make a difference for the elimination of oil glut. Despite the Saudi Arabia’s hopefulness, scepticism still prevails among analysts doubtful that OPEC will ever find a solution to the problem with oil oversupply. Reacting to this news, global markets were mixed on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. The US market was mostly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrials shed 0.16%. The S&P 500 edged 0.30% lower; the NASDAQ sank 0.65%. European stocks advanced overall on Thursday, helped by the strong report on the UK gross domestic product, even though poor Chinese data and mixed earning reports checked in markets’ advance further. On Thursday afternoon, The FTSE rose 0.4%; the DAX was 0.1% higher; and the CAC added minor 1.02 points. The SMI also closed 0.4% higher. On Friday morning, however, European markets moved to negative territory. The FTSE opened 0.24% lower; the DAX lost 0.53%; the CAC slid 0.03%. Asian markets fared better on Friday and ended the trading day mixed. Japan markets advanced pushed higher by the good performance of Finance and Investment, Textile, and Marine Transport sectors.

Both events heightened investors’ uncertainty about the winner of the Presidential Elections and the resolution of oil glut problem. Another piece of news came out on Friday and was more cheerful: the first estimate of third quarter growth. GDP was higher 2.9% after it had grown 1.4% in the second quarter. Last time when the growth of GDP was that high was in the last quarter of 2014. Consumer sentiment index reading for October was 87.2, which is a decline from September’s final reading of 91.2. With investors disturbed by the FBI’s investigations and OPEC’s inability to make a progress in talks, European market slid on Monday. The FTSE shed 0.33%; the DAX retreated 0.34%; the CAC sank 0.53%. Shipbuilding, Steel, and Mining sectors pushed Japanese market lower. The Nikkei was 0.12% down. The Hang Seng inched 0.09% lower. Australian stocks were the only stocks in the Asia-Pacific region that appreciated on Monday boosted by the good performance of the Gold, Steel, and Mining sectors. The S&P/ASX rose 0.64%. The US stocked closed in the red on Friday but advanced slightly at the beginning of the day on Monday, after investors started coming to terms with the news about the renewed probe into Clinton’s email.

The reversal in their fortune was caused by the results achieved at the central banks’ meetings in the US and Japan. Both the Feds and BoJ did not introduce changes into their monetary policy but decided to hold it steady. Although they had long anticipated that no change in the central banks’ policy would occur, investors still reacted bitterly to the expected news and allowed stocks to tumble. The only (partially) positive results coming out of the central banks’ inaction were a jump of a yen: helped by Japan’s refusal to ease monetary policy, it reached on Wednesday the highest level since August of 2014. Embittered by the stability of the banks’ policies, investors, as they usually do in the unstable times of a weak dollar, rushed to the safe haven – gold – and brought it up even higher, causing it to soar for the seventh day in a row."

The US market, however, finished in the red. Several events weighted heavily upon investors’ minds and influenced the performance of stocks for the worse. One of them was the approaching Brexit’s meeting that disallowed investors to make bold moves in anticipation that the UK might exit the European Union and the chaos will ensue. Another event that drove investors out of humour on Friday was the refusal of the Bank of Japan to change its monetary policy. Other banks followed suit also maintaining status quo in their monetary policies, which did not add to investors’ optimism either. Dow Jones Industrials shed 0.33%. S&P 50 had the worst week since April losing 0.33%. NASDAQ retreated 0.92%. In Europe, the picture was slightly brighter: all major indices ended in the green. The FTSE added 1.19%. The DAX finished 0.85% higher. The CAC rose 0.98%."

The bank of Japan, likewise, insisted on maintaining its interest rates just as they are at present. The Bank of England refrained from changing its monetary policy, choosing to wait for the outcome of the referendum on the 23d of June. The Swiss National Bank decided that negative interest rates are conducive to the growth of the Swiss franc and left them unchanged."

The number was well above the expectation of 180K, and came along with upward revisions to the June and May reports which brought the three month average up to 190,000. Headline unemployment remained level since last month at 4.9%, and hourly earnings showed an increase of 0.3%, exceeding the 0.2% forecast.</p><p>The good news from the jobs front helped to counteract the gloomy market sentiment after the Q2 GDP number came in at only 1.2%, and has boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement another interest rate hike later this year. Futures traders are putting the chance of a September hike at 26%, and of a December move at 48%. The increasing odds for September are interesting, as it would require the Fed moving before the Presidential election in November.</p><p>There were some spots of gloom in the jobs report. The NFP showed that the rate of underemployment &ndash; US workers in part time jobs but looking for full time &ndash; increased to 9.7%, and that the raw number of workers in part time work for \"economic reasons\" &ndash; their employer cut their hours, usually &ndash; increased to 5.94 million. The number of Americans discouraged and dropping out of the workforce also increased during July.</p><p>Still, the overall news was good, and the NFP gave US stock markets a shot in the arm on Friday. The Dow Jones gained 1.04%, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.86%, and the NASDAQ advanced 1.06%.</p><p>European markets also responded well to the American jobs report, and the FTSE 100 in London finished with a gain of 0.79%, the DAX added 1.36%, and the CAC 40 gained 1.49%. While European markets were in the green before the NFP release, they picked up their gains sharply afterwards.</p><p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region had mostly closed by the time of the US jobs report release, but they are still worth looking at. Tokyo was flat, or showed small losses &ndash; the Nikkei 225 showed no change and the TOPIX fell 0.24%. In China, the Hang Seng gained 1.44%, while the SCI 300 on the mainland added just 0.12%.

Despite these losses, gold is still up about 25% for the year to date.</p><p>The oil markets are just plain confusing lately. Prices are up, as the Saudis have been talking again about production cuts. The OPEC nations are to meet informally next month, and oil spokesmen for the kingdom have hinted that Saudi Arabia may be willing to discuss output cuts at that time. Russia has hinted that it, too, may cooperate with cuts. At the same time, Iran and Nigeria have both said, \"No cuts from us,\" and the active rig count in the US continues to rise. Crude oil stockpiles in the US saw a large draw, but gasoline stocks increased by 2.2 million barrels last week.</p><p>To make sense of all of this, it's important to consider the intersection of supply and demand with politics and national budgets. Globally, supply is very high while demand is weak or slowing; politically, Saudi Arabia and Russia both need higher prices to make budget ends meet, but neither can afford to cut production and risk losing market share. Iran and Nigeria are both trying to increase production to regain market share. Expect confusion in the oil markets.</p><p>Price-wise, Brent crude now stands at $48.74 per barrel, down 1% from yesterday, while in the US, West Texas Intermediate is selling for $46.15, down 0.92%..</p>"

The statement boosted the dollar, and helped the greenback to slow its recent slide and pare back losses slightly. Dudley's statements comes despite recent economic reports showing that economic growth in the US, while real, has been uneven. Regarding US markets, the economic signals been truly mixed. The last two months' labor reports have been good, but industrial production remains and retail sales remain down.</p><p>In the wake of Dudley's speech, US stocks slipped slightly from recent record highs. Investors were taking profits and taking on a wait-and-see stance. This past December, the Fed made its first rate hike in 9 years, and markets responded with sharp drops. That, plus the unsteady global economic recovery, has both the Fed and investors on a cautious mode. Most investors doubt that there will be a rate hike as early as September, citing the US election on November 8. Futures markets put the odds of a rate hike at just 22% before the election, and only 45% in December.</p><p>Wall Street's indexes remain at high levels, despite the slight paring. The Dow was down 0.45% at the finish, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.55%, and the NASDAQ slipped 0.66%. All three set record highs in Monday's session.</p><p>In Europe, the markets are opening to losses after a down finish yesterday. London's FTSE 100 index has slipped 0.16% in early trading, the DAX is down 0.82%, and the CAC 40 has dropped 0.67%.</p><p>Asia's markets are showing mixed results in today's session, with losses in China buy gains in Japan and Australia. Shanghai's CSI 300 is down 0.15% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng has slipped 0.48%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 picked up 0.90% and the TOPIX gained 0.97%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX squeaked out a modest 0.06% gain.</p>"

The Fed minutes were dovish in tone, reflecting a divided committee that is unsure how to proceed. The image presented a decided contrast to recent statements from New York Fed president William Dudley to the effect that there could be a further rate hike even before the November election.</p><p>The dollar tumbled during the confusion, of course, while gold and the Wall Street indexes rose as some investors moved toward higher returns and others looked to haven assets. Traders now are looking towards Fed chair Janet Yellen's scheduled speech at the Jackson Hole conference of global policy makers next week.</p><p>In the meantime, the stock indexes rallied at the end of the session yesterday. The Dow finished with a gain of 0.12% and the S&amp;amp;P 500 picked up 0.19%. The NASDAQ's gain was smaller, just 0.03%.</p><p>Stocks in Asia were mostly down. Reports from Japan showed that imports and exports continue to drop, an ominous sign in a trade-driven economy. Imports were down more than 24% year-over- year, marking the nineteenth consecutive month of year-over- year declines, while exports dropped 14% year-over- year for the worst showing in nearly 7 years. In short, the trade numbers were disastrous for Japan.</p><p>The trade situation isn't helped any by the strengthening in the yen. The yen has gained on haven trading as the dollar has tumbled in the markets. The result was a bad day yesterday for Japanese stocks, which normally trade inversely to the currency. The Nikkei 225 and the TOPIX were both down by 1.55%.</p><p>Other Asia-Pacific region stocks also fared poorly. The Australian S&P ASX dipped 0.49%, and in Shanghai the CSI 300 index lost a quarter percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was theexception, gaining 0.89%.</p><p>The European markets finished in the red yesterday, but have opened higher in early trading today. Gains on the FTSE 100, the DAX, and the CAC 40 range from 0.26% to 0.38%.</p>"

After the exaltation that everyone had felt upon the announcement of OPEC’s meeting in September, everyone realized that the forthcoming talks will not bring an expected freeze of oil production. Analysts are convinced that even if Russia agrees in Algiers to curb the oversupply, the Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose hatred for each other had prevented negotiations on previous occasions, would not close a meaningful deal this time either. Other factors also contribute to the overall pessimism about the future of oil. The US increased drilling for the last couple of months; China’s export of diesel and gasoline more than doubled in July. Therefore, even in the best case scenario, when oil production indeed gets frozen in September, freezing at current level delays re-balancing by a year. The realization that the meeting in Algiers will not solve the problem of oil oversupply shed a different light also on the recent jump in oil prices. Now it is clear that the price increase was short-lived and more technical than fundamental. On Friday and Monday oil prices resumed their downward movement.</p><p>Prices of gold also dropped on Monday to its two week low thanks to the growing dollar and investors’ apprehensions that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in September. The opinion that the US economy is healing was expressed by San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, who added that putting off an increase further would only hurt the economy. In his statement, John Williams seconded the opinion of William Dudley expressed earlier last week. Major indices also took a plunge in the US. Dow Jones industrials declined 0.24%. The S&P shed 0.14%. The NASDAQ decreased 0.03%. The overall situation was more cheerful in Europe, where indices rose. The FTSE advanced 0.02%; the DAX jumped 0.82%; the CAC added 0.69%.</p>"

New housing data demonstrated that in the US, July new home sales grew 12.4%. August flash PMI data was also good, showing that Europe was not crushed by the UK’s decision to part company with it. Quite the contrary, the new data revealed that European business conspicuously boasts signs of growth. The arrival of positive news brought investors out of sluggishness that characterized their activities on Monday. Trading became more spirited and profitable. All American indices added. The Dow Jones was 0.1% up. The S&P rose 0.2%. The NASDAQ closed 0.3% higher. In Europe, too, all indices finished the trading day firmly in the positive territory. The FTSE advanced 0.6%. The CAC jumped 0.7%. The German’s DAX soared 0.9%. The SMI surged 0.5%. On Wednesday morning, the upward trend among indices continued. All indices were on the levels at which they had closed a day before. The only fly in the ointment for investors was oil that was still inexorably falling. Oil demand is low in China; the US cannot store more oil; Saudi Arabia that recently talked oil prices up will not stop pumping. Oil oversupply is not going away but will remain a serious problem for at least a year, even if at the forthcoming OPEC meeting all countries agree to curb their oil production to the maximum.</p>"

Toll Brothers, PulteGroup, and Lennar led the way among home builders. Having presented better than expected results, Best Buy also advanced. The retailer added 19.60%, proving that its turnaround strategy was succeeding. Despite the decline of oil, energy companies did better than on Monday. Chesapeake Energy and Marathon Oil gained. After announcing a possible merger with Bayer AG, Monsanto, a publicly traded American multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation, also surged.</p><p>European Market. Stocks were up. Banks, automakers, and miners were at the forefront of the market in Europe. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank,Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole ended the day firmly in the positive territory. Automakers Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler closed higher. Intending to sell its DTN, a data service and an agriculture news, for $1.5 billion, Schneider Electric gained. Persimmon continued its upward movement for the second day, after it had demonstrated that its first-half profit exceeded 29%. Taylor Wimpey rose, and so did Berkeley Group Holdings. Because its losses were lower than those of other retailers, shares of Tesco also went higher. BHP Billiton, too, ended the day in the green. Straumann Holding, a company specializing in implant and restorative dentistry and oral tissue regeneration, also advanced.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. The growing yen that is now on the 100 level against the US dollar brought the Nikkei down: the index closed 0.6% lower. As is always the case, when the yen is heading upward, exporters dipped. Shares of Canon, Panasonic, Nissan Motor, Toyota, Honda Motor, and Mazda sank. Thanks to rumours that it is going to purchase Intersil, Renesas Electronics tumbled. Sharp followed suit and also slipped. In Australia, the S&P/ASX added 0.7%. The All Ordinaries appreciated 0.6%. The banks soared along with BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group. After it had demonstrated that its profit for a year was three times higher, Vocus Communications, an Australian telecommunication provider, significantly advanced. Because its first-half profit had fallen 89%, Oil Search decreased. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.4% helped by Samsung Electronics that turned in excellent performance on Tuesday. The Sensex and Hang Seng did not change much. The Shanghai Composite inched 0.2% higher.</p>"

Investors continued procrastinating in expectations of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s announcement at the Kansas City Fed’s monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole. Everyone expects rates to be increased, considering recent comments by William Dudley and Stanley Fisher followed by equally hawkish observations made by Esther George, Kansas City Fed President, and Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed President. The probability of a Fed rate increase in September is 32%. The optimism sounded in the observations of policymakers pushed financial stocks higher but not significantly enough to offset markets’ general decline on Thursday. Healthcare companies along with consumer stocks bore the brunt of markets’ losses. On Thursday evening and Friday morning, the Dow Jones industrials shed 0.2%. The S&P inched 0.1% lower. The NASDAQ lost as much. In Europe, all indices retreated as well. The FTSE slid 0.3%. The DAX was 0.9% lower. The CAC decreased 0.7%. The SMI also dropped 0.7%. On Friday morning, the FTSE was 0.01% down. The DAX sank 0.15%. The CAC finished 0.20% lower. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped to a two-week low. Japanese equities suffered the biggest decline. The dollar appreciated against the yen that traded 100.43 per dollar. The British pound gained 1.1% on the week, showing that British economy proved to be unshaken by the Brexit’s victory. Crude oil price was 0.2% lower, trading $47 per barrel, which marked the end of its price hike caused by Saudi Arabia’s earlier promise to freeze oil prices and Iran’s willingness to attend OPEC’s informal meeting in Algiers in September.

                      "text": "<p>The major event happening on Friday, 26 August 2016, was Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech at the summit at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The most leading question that weighted upon everyone’s mind last week was whether Federal Reserve was going to increase rates this year. In her speech, Professor Yellen made clear that the U.S. Central bank is going to increase rates as soon as next month. The reason why she thinks a rate hike is possible lies in the continued good performance of the labor market: there were about 190,000 jobs added over the past free months. The August job reports that are going to be published at the end of this week are expected to influence further the Federal Reserve decision to increase rates. Moreover, analysts think that the Federal Reserve will not stop at one rate hike this year but will increase rates twice or even more times. The goal of the U.S. central bank should be striking a balance between boosting up the economic growth and overheating the economy. While the most significant announcement Professor Yellen made was about the rate increase, she spent the most of the time during her speech talking about the need to develop new tools in addition to those which the Federal Reserve is using now in order to face the next recession more successfully.</p><p>Another piece of news that came off on Friday was the address of German Deputy Foreign minister, Michael Roth, to the UK. He said that the UK’s separation from the European Union will not be easy and that the UK is not going to receive the best aspects that the Union offers. He made clear that if there are restrictions for the Germans, Italians, and Polish to access Britain and if Britain itself wants to access market fully, the European Union is not going to cooperate in this.</p><p>At stock markets, shares of Saudi Arabia tumbled the most, hitting a five years low. Only this year, the Tadawul All Share Index became 14% lower. Companies in this index trade at about 11.7 times future earnings, as opposed to 12.5 for the measure set for developing countries. A continued drop of oil prices does not help the largest crude exporter in the world. On Friday, U.S crude dipped 0.32% to reach US$47.18. Brent crude fell 0.52% to US$49.41. Everyone realizes now that an agreement to curtail oil production is not going to be reached. Energy Minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, said on Thursday that there would be no meaningful intervention in the market. Because the US continues to increase the number of active rigs, already having as many as 406, oil glut remains a persistent problem for the world at the moment. The US dollar moved downwards before Fed Reserve Chair Professor Janet Yellen’s speech.</p><p>Apart from European Indices that ended the trading day on Friday in the green, other indices throughout the world were mixed. The Dow Jones sank 0.29%. The S&P shed 0.16%. Unlike these US indices, the NASDAQ appreciated 0.13%. Major indices in the Asia-Pacific region were also mixed. Even though the yen rose, the Nikkei still could not pull it off and lost 1.18%. The S&P/ASX declined 0.48%. The Hang Seng was the only index that added on Friday. It was 0.41% up. The European indices soared. The FTSE edged 0.3% higher. The CAC jumped 0.80%. The DAX advanced 0.55%. The IBEX also ended the trading Friday session higher. It was 0.70% up.</p>"

Optimistic about the state of a job market and economy’s growth, Professor Yellen said that a rate increase is highly probable. Although she did not talk about a deadline for a rate hike, analysts think that rates can be increased as early as in September. Additional increases are also possible this year. Fed Reserve chairwoman’s speech did not drastically influence markets’ performance. A low-volume, unprofitable trading that characterised global markets at the beginning of the week dragged on till its end. The US indices were mostly down. The Dow Jones shed 0.3% on Friday and 0.8% for the week. The S&P dipped 0.2% on a day and 0.7% since the last week. Although the NASDAQ inched 0.1% higher on Friday, it dropped 0.4% on the week. European market presented a slightly brighter picture: all its indices managed to move to the positive territory on Friday. The FTSE advanced 0.3%. The SMI added as much. The CAC rose 0.8% on Friday and 0.9% since the previous week. The DAX was 0.6% higher on the day and 0.4% on the week. The SMI appreciated 0.5% since the last Friday. The FTSE was the only index that lost for the week, shedding 0.3%. Overwhelming pessimism about the future of oil reigned at the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere in the world. Iran recently made clear that it was not going to reduce crude production, since it wanted to regain its OPEC market share. Iran’s insistence on pumping more oil sabotages an oil freeze that some other oil-producing countries are willing to implement. More and more people are starting to realize that an oil freeze is not going to be achieved.</p>"

Because its current quarter outlook is weak, Ultra Salon Cosmetics & Fragrance had a 6.12% slide, hitting the lowest point since November 2015. Involved in a difficult law case filed against Abbott Laboratories in order to complete their takeover deal, Alere sank. Abbott Laboratories, by contrast, remained stable, having its stocks sold for US$42.98. Herbalife declined 2.31% on rumours that its biggest shareholder was seeking to sell his shares.</p><p>European Market. Because it planned to spend $1.4 billion to compensate those dealers who had lost in its diesel cheating scheme, Volkswagen appreciated. Other automakers were also up: BMW, Daimler, Peugeot, and Renault gained. Having lost more than expected in its second quarter profits, Vivendi, a French multinational mass media company, shed 0.93%. Having promised to change its marketing strategies, Restaurant Group added 4.98% at London stock exchange. Amec Foster Wheeler added 6.03%. BAE Systems, a British multinational defence, security, and aerospace company, edged 1.10% up.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. The Shanghai Composite inched 0.1% on Friday. The Hang Seng rose 0.4%. On the week, the former dipped 1.2%. The latter dropped 0.1%. Because of continuously sinking oil prices, July consumer prices were again low, for the fifth month in the row. The Nikkei was down both on Friday and for the week: 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. As a corollary, exporters drifted lower – Canon, Sony, Toshiba, Mazda Motor, Advantest, Toyota, and Honda were among the losers. Capcom, a gaming company, finished the day in the green. Kao, a cosmetic company, did too. In Australia, both the S&P/ASX and the All Ordinaries retreated on Friday and for the week. The first index dipped 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. The All Ordinaries slipped 0.4% for the day and 0.3% since the last Friday. The banks moved into the negative territory.  BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto slid, as did Coca Cola Amatil. Having reported that its full-year profit increased almost 4 times, Mayne Pharma did slightly better than before. Super Retail Group added 5.87%. The Kospi lost both on Friday and for the week – 0.3% and 0.9% respectively. The Sensex also sank both on Friday (0.2%) and for the week (1.0%). </p>"

The indications are bearish for the dollar, as a continuation of the current low rates will hold down returns on investments, and traders started moving toward haven assets.</p><p>The immediate benefits of the Fed comments were felt by the Japanese yen, and in the gold markets. The USD/JPY pair has retreated to 101.94 and the EUR/JPY dipped to 114.53. The price of gold is up more than three dollars to trade at $1,330.00 per ounce.</p><p>In the oil markets, supply and demand is still dominating crude prices. US rig counts have increased for 10 of the last 11 weeks, indicating an increase in production activity, a probably future increase in output, and the shale industry's ability to adapt to a low-price regime. In addition, the OPEC cartel released estimates showing they foresee an increase in non-OPEC production this year. Within the OPEC cartel, production levels are already at record highs.</p><p>The constant production is feeding into supply glut that has pressed down on oil markets form most of the last two years, and helping strengthen the market resistance at the $50 level. Currently, the US benchmark WTI grade is selling for $45.25 per barrel and Brent, the global trading benchmark, is priced at $47.40. Both are trending downward.</p>"

Asian markets advanced, helped by exporters and the yen that on Tuesday experienced its biggest decline since August. Asian emerging-market stocks, by contrast, were low, and so were their currencies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped on rumours that the European Central Banks was planning to stop quantitative easing. Federal Reserve officials also contributed to its decline by hinting that interest rates would be increased this year. In the US, shares of utilities and real estate companies decreased and pulled the whole market down. Dividend paying companies were low, because investors expect rates to rise together with the yields on bonds. Prices of oil continued growing, thanks to shrinking of American stock piles; inventories decreased by 7.6 million barrels last week. Copper, nickel, and lead extended their losses for the third day already. The New Zealand dollar tumbled to a seven-week low brought down by a fall of global dairy prices. The British pound hit its lowest level in 31 years, after British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the UK is ready to give up membership of Europe’s single market in its separation from the European Union. The Dow Jones was 0.47% lower; the S&P 500 dropped 0.50%; the NASDAQ retreated 0.21%; the FTSE lost 0.22%; the German DAX edged 0.86% lower; the CAC depreciated 1.02%; the Nikkei soared 0.50%; the Hang Seng surged 0.23%; the Australian S&P/ASX was 0.57% down.</p>"

Apple was also higher, advancing 0.43%.</p><p>European Market. Eurozone producer prices for August shed 002%. Spain’s September unemployment hit its lowest level in seven years. Thanks to increased building of residential homes, the UK construction PMI jumped to 52.3 in September from 49.2 in the previous month. Deutsche Bank advanced after the US Department of Justice had cut its fine more than half.

Glencore offered to buy back its debt and rose but fell slightly – 1.86% - on Wednesday.  Intertek Group finished higher, and so did Greggs, whose third-quarter sales were predictively high. Because gold was lower than usual, Randgold Resources shed 2.32%. Fresnillo lost 1.97%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Because the yen deprecated and Japan consumer confidence was higher than everyone expected, the Nikkei jumped 0.50%. Topix was also 0.57% up. For the same reasons, exporters Sony, Mazda Motor, Toshiba, Panasonic, and Honda Motor gained. The camera maker Olympus also was 0.27% higher. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial was 1.22% up. When it offered to buy Bradken for A$689 million, Hitachi Construction Machinery added 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its increase rate without changes at 1.5%. Low inflation and high Australian Dollar caused it to maintain an existing level of rates. Banks were mixed. Miners and energy companies appreciated. Rio Tinto added on Tuesday but dipped 1.11% on Wednesday. Santos jumped on both days, increasing 1.58% on Wednesday. The Kospi finished Tuesday 0.5% higher. The Sensex edged 0.3% up, after the Reserve Bank of India lowered the key policy rate by 25 basis points.</p>"

The reports indicated that the share of working age people in the labour market hit a six-month high in September. Wages also grew. The unemployment rate advanced 5%, however. The Vice Chairman of Federal Reserve, Stanley Fischer, sounded optimistic about the job situation, saying that the creation of new job places goes together with lower unemployment, even though this is still hindered by slow general economic development. Good labour reports immediately boosted chances of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike this year. Despite the upbeat news, there were no drastic changes at stock markets: neither dollar nor bonds altered significantly on Friday. What did experience changes on Friday was oil. After Russia expressed unwillingness to make a deal with OPEC next week in Istanbul, oil slipped 1.3%, that is, below US$50 per barrel. The pound also slowed its downward movement, though still remaining 1.5% down. Stocks dropped for the first time in four weeks. In the US, stocks were pulled lower by industrial companies, whose shares dipped after Honeywell International shed 7.51%. The FTSE, however, soared 0.9%, brought higher by exporting companies that, in their turn, benefited from the falling pound.  The Dow Jones decreased 0.15%; the S&P 500 lost 0.33%; the NASDAQ dropped 0.27%; the DAX dipped 0.74%; the CAC declined 0.67%; the Nikkei had a 0.23% slide; the Hang Seng edged 0.42% lower; and the Australian S&P/ASX was 0.29% down.</p>"

Apple also appreciated, edging 0.15% higher. Hit by hurricane Matthew that brought the insurance industry huge losses, Florida insurance companies slid. Having declined, some of them managed, however, to advance later. On Sunday morning, Heritage Insurance showed a 5.94% advance; Universal Insurance was 14.51% in the green.  Having published poor forecast for 2018, Walmart shed 0.95%. Still haunted by accusations that it had been consistently overcharging its clients for its EpiPen allergy treatment, Mylan got reduced 2.44%.

Osram, a multinational lightning manufacturer, jumped, because there were rumours that it had a buying offer from a Chinese chipmaker. Osram, however, later shed 3.72%. Air France KLM slid in France, and so did EasyJet, after the company updated its profit outlook. EasyJet dipped 4.01%. Smith & Nephew, a multinational medical equipment company based in the UK, dropped on a broker downgrade but managed to rise 1.41% later.

Because US job data was good and led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve would increase rates in 2016, the majority of Gulf markets declined: riskier assets are losing their attraction. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index deplored its first decline (0.5%) in four days. The BGCC 200 Index edged 0.3% lower, since shares in Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Bahrain composing the Index all dipped dramatically. The Nikkei lost 0.23%, even though on Thursday the Index was higher, along with Topix. Exporters Toyota Motor, Mazda, and Hitachi did well. Banks were also in positive territory.  After it became known that Lenovo Group was negotiating with Fujitsu the companies’ merger, Fujitsu advanced 0.25%. Lenovo Group, by contrast, depreciated 1.14%. The S&P/ASX in Australia decreased 0.29%, even though energy stocks fared well. BHP Billiton jumped 2.80%. Fortescue Metals Group added 0.20%.

The US stocks remained virtually unchanged during the trading day, unmoved even by the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes from September 21 FOMC meeting. As minutes made clear, some policymakers feared that postponing the rate increase would eventually require to increase rates more speedily in future. Other Federal Reserve’s members said, by contrast, that there was no hurry to raise rates: economists needed to check whether the inflation would continue improving. As policymakers made clear, they would not increase rates in November, though they might do this in December, before the year ends. The probability of the Federal Reserve’s increase in US borrowing costs by the end of the year rose 5%, estimated now around 68%. European market slid on concerns over the Federal Reserve’s intimation that it might raise rates before the year’s end. The sell-off of Chinese stalks also weighed on investors’ spirits. A drastic decline of Chines exports - 10% from the last year – and a concomitant decrease of Chinese import were taken as signs of the poor global economy in general and of Chinese economic downfall in particular. New economic reports revealed on Thursday that China’s trade surplus slipped from $52.05 billion in August to US$41.99 billion in September. China’s currency was at its six-year low against the US dollar. Overwhelmed with the same worries, Asian market also tumbled on Wednesday. Stocks in Hong Kong hit their six-week low.

Because of it, the S&amp;amp;P 500 dipped 0.31%. The NASDAQ retreated 0.63%. Boeing, by contrast, added 4.69% and arrested the downward movement of the US markets, pushing the Dow Jones Industrials 0.17% up. Boeing reached the highest level this year, having showed good&nbsp;quarterly profits. European market was also pulled in different directions because of sinking oil prices and mixed corporate earnings results. Negatively influenced by low commodities prices, energy stocks decreased but managed to balance out their losses later, after the US EIA report indicated a drop in crude inventories. Low prices of precious metals negatively affected shares of mining and resource companies. The FTSE lost 0.85%. The DAX slipped 0.44%. The CAC was 0.14% down. Asian markets extended their losses for the second day, brought lower by weakened energy stocks. Treasuries performed badly as well, negatively affected by the new data arriving from America that showed that new home sales had been unexpectedly high in September. Apple that had dragged American stocks lower on Wednesday also contributed to Asian markets&rsquo; general decline. Australian markets followed suit and closed lower because of losing Mining, Metals, and Resources companies. The Nikkei in Tokyo slumped 0.32%. The Hang Seng led Asian markets&rsquo; retreat being 0.95% lower. The S&amp;P/ASX shed 1.20%.</p>"

                      "text": "<p>US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, weakened by the Oil and Gas, Telecoms, and Utilities sectors. Investors’ worries over the outcome of the Presidential elections have increasingly been growing since Donald Trump’s chances to become an American president strengthened. Trump’s advance spreads panic among investors, since they know what to expect from Hilary Clinton; Donald Trump is generally considered a dark horse, whose influence on the future of the country is difficult to predict. The Federal Reserve’s inactivity further aggravated everyone’s anxiety. Although, as usual, the Federal Reserve’s officials refused to spell their intentions out, they hinted that a rate hike by the end of 2016 still remains a very strong probability. Weighted down by investors’ concerns about the election and a December rates increase, the Dow Jones Industrials closed 0.43% down and thereby hit a three-month low. The S&P 500 sank 0.65%, experiencing its longest drop since 2011. The NASDAQ decreased 0.93%. Asian markets fluctuated between gains and losses, either closing flat or slightly gaining. Shanghai Composite rose 0.5%. The Nikkei was shut for the holiday and thus avoided drifting lower because of the growing yen. The Hang Seng dropped 0.56%. Australian markets declined, brought down by the poor performance of the Utilities and Consumer Discretionary sectors. The S&P/ASX inched 0.07% lower. Unlike Asian and American stocks, European market steadied on Thursday morning and remained mostly in the green, save only the German DAX index that dipped 0.02 % lower. Investors’ attention is focused today on the statement that the Bank of England is issuing in the afternoon. As elsewhere in the world, the forthcoming Presidential Elections in the US also weighed on investors’ minds and slowed down trading. The Euro Stoxx 50 appreciated 0.10%. The FTSE in London edged 0.15% higher. The French CAC rose 0.11%.</p>"

In the morning, however, oil prices advanced slightly, rising from five-week lows. Oil prices were pushed up by the falling dollar. WTI added 0.90% to US$45.75. Brent Crude advanced 0.96% and traded at US$47.31. Gold prices fell on Thursday, weakened by expectations of the Federal Reserve’s possible rate increase in December.

                      "text": "<p>Trading was low volume and largely uneventful. Global stocks extended their losses to the last day of the trading week. The last time stocks experienced such terrible sell off was in June, when Brexit won the vote and announced the UK’s separation from the European Union. Investors lost their appetite for riskier deals and temporised ahead of the Presidential Elections next week and in expectation of US job reports later today. Investors are also preoccupied with the Federal Reserve’s rates hike in December, evaluating chances of a rates increase as high as 71.5%. US shares dipped following poll results showing that Clinton is only three points ahead of Donald Trump, which is a much narrower gap between them than, say, in the middle of October. The S&P 500 Index is having the longest period of losses since 2008. Planted in negative territory on Friday, the S&P had the worst streak of losses since 1980. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index also fell the deepest in seven weeks. The Topix index sank 1.6%. After jumping to the highest peak in a month on Wednesday, gold slid 0.4%. Crude oil also tumbled 8% this week, after US oil stockpiles substantially grew. On Friday, however, Crude oil advanced 0.3% but was still unable to pare its weekly losses. The yen is heading for its biggest weekly advance since July, supported by investors’ turn to safe haven. The euro and Swiss franc also celebrated gains. Dollar’s index dropped. The Turkish lira shed 0.9% after Turkish police rounded up Kurdish lawmakers. The pound has a 2.3% weekly advance, boosted by the news that Theresa May needs an approval of the Parliament to start exiting the European Union. The New Zealand kiwi led the gains among Asian currencies. The Dow Jones Industrials declined 0.16%; the S&P 500 was 0.44% lower; the NASDAQ shed 0.92%; the Euro Stoxx 50 decreased 0.69%; the FTSE plunged 1.05%; the DAX tumbled 0.73%; the CAC slipped 0.59%; the Nikkei lost 1.34%; the Hang Seng skidded 0.18%; and the S&P/ASX slid 0.86%.</p>"

Despite Friday gains, oil is set up for an 8% of weekly loss. WTI inched 0.13% up to US$44.72; Brent Crude also added 0.13% and traded up to US$46.41. Gold prices were lower on Friday but gold is not expected to fall deeply in such uncertain times as now.  Gold futures dipped 0.29% to trade at US$1,302.45. Silver futures declined 0.78% to US$18.35. Copper retreated 0.18% from its highest level since June to reach US$2.24.  Platinum lost 0.24%, trading at US$993.89. Zinc slipped from a five-year peak.</p>"

The People's Bank of China set the currency's trading midpoint at 6.9498, which is actually a game of catch up as the less official offshore rate is already closing on 7 yuan to the dollar.</p><p>The dollar, meanwhile, is seeing strong gains today. The USD/JPY is up to 118.14 and the USD/CHF has gained to 1.0277. The EUR/USD slid down a bit, to 1.0411 and the GBP/USD remains low at 1.2291.</p><p>In commodity markets, oil has gained on reports that Kuwait is honoring its production cutback commitments. Brent crude is up to $58.08 per barrel, and WTI, the US benchmark price, is up to $54.96.</p><p>Precious metals are up, as well. Gold is trading at $1,148.25 per ounce, and platinum is selling for $907.15. Silver is down slightly, at $15.97 per ounce. In industrial metals, copper is up to $2.54 per pound, on optimism about Chinese manufacturing. China is the world's largest single consumer of copper, accounting for 45% of the world's copper use, so a boost in their manufacturing sector will boost copper as well.</p><p>That's the trading news in a nutshell.

                      "text": "<p>Stocks were up in the US yesterday, while the European markets are opening to losses today. The Asia-Pacific region saw mostly gains in today's session.</p><p>The Dow Jones is up by 0.60%. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ both gained 0.85%; it was the best showing the S&P in over a year. In Asia, the Tokyo's markets saw large gains, as the Nikkei 225 picked up 2.51% and the TOPIX index advanced 2.36%. The CSI 300 index in Shanghai gained 0.78%, but the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.07%. Europe's major markets are the odd man out today, showing losses in the early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.02%, the DAX has slipped a quarter percent, and the CAC 40 is down 0.06%.</p><p>In currency trading, the US dollar is down slightly after yesterday's gains, mostly as investors took profits. The EUR/USD is up to 1.0436, the GBP/USD is up to 1.2281, and the AUD/USD is trading at 0.7263. The USD/JPY has dipped to 117.53 and the USD/CHF is down at 1.0255. The dollar has lost the most against the Canadian loonie, as that currency has gotten a boost from recent gains in oil (despite today's dip in crude prices). The USD/CAD is down 0.82%, to 1.3317.</p><p>As mentioned, oil has slipped today. Like the dollar, this is on profit taking as investors realize what they can from recent gains. Crude markets are a bit different, however, as traders are also worried that the source of those recent gains – the OPEC agreement to cut back on production in cooperation with non-OPEC countries – may be more fragile than the major producing countries want people to think. Libya and Nigeria are both exempt from the cuts, and both are trying to ramp up production, and in the US, which was never a party to the agreement, oil companies are expanding operations in the shale patches. Industry analysts are uncertain about the future of the oil markets. Right now, Brent crude is priced at $55.81 per barrel and WTI is set at $52.64.</p><p>While oil is down, precious metals are up. Gold has gained almost two-thirds of a percent, to reach $1,166.08 per ounce, silver is selling at $16.44, and platinum has gained 0.95% and stands at $945.39. These gains may be fleeting, however, as the US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates three times this year. Watch for the Fed's December meeting minutes today, and see how metals react to that news.</p><p>Coming up on Friday, watch for the US jobs report from the Department of Labor. A strong report is sure to be used as justification for the Fed's projected moves on rates, and will likely boost the dollar and hurt gold.</p>"

                      "text": "<p>Friday saw the release of the Non-Farm Payroll report in the US, the government's monthly summary of labor market conditions. Also referred to as the NFP or the jobs report, the data release by the Department of Labor showed a headline print of 156,000 new jobs created in December, and 2.2 million new jobs for 2016 as a whole. They were good numbers, but the monthly data missed expectations by 22,000 and the yearly number was a half-million lower than 2015. Unemployment ticked up slightly to 4.7%, and the labor force participation rate remained mired near 35-year high levels, at 62.7%.</p><p>Wall Street responded well to the jobs report data, with the main indexes reaching record level highs. At one point during Friday's trading session the Dow Jones average reached 19,999.63, before slipping back to finish the day at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ gained 0.35% and 0.60% respectively. Stocks also gained in Europe. The FTSE 100 in London picked up 0.33%, the DAX added 0.12%, and the CAC 40 gained 0.60%. Trading was relatively quiet in London, but more volatile on the Continent.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific region saw more mixed trading, with gains in Hong Kong and Australia but losses in Japan and mainland China. The Hang Seng picked up 0.21% and the S&P ASX gained a thin 0.04%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 0.34% and the TOPIX slipped 0.15%. Shanghai's CSI 300 index saw a loss of 0.60% for the day.</p><p>The currency markets saw gains across the board for the US dollar. The EUR/USD slipped to 1.0532, the GBP/USD dropped to 1.2287, and the AUD/USD dropped to 0.7301. The USD/JPY showed the largest gains for the dollar, adding 1.45% to reach 117.02. The USD/CAD advanced to 1.3237, and the USD/CHF increased to 1.0180. The dollar has been consistently above parity with the Swiss franc since November 15.</p><p>Oil prices were basically stable to close out last week. The global trading benchmark grade, Brent crude, ended at $57.10 per barrel, and the US benchmark, WTI, closed at $53.99. The oil markets are getting price support from OPEC giants Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, both of which have indicated that they will comply with the recent agreement to cut back on production. The agreement was negotiated within OPEC and with other major oil producers in an effort to cut into the global oil supply glut and provide price support for the markets. Oil industry analysts are pointing to $60 per barrel as a natural price level in the current market conditions.</p><p>Precious metals rose through most of last week, but gold and silver pulled back on Friday. Gold is priced at $$1,172.63 per ounce, down 0.63% from the week's high point, while silver slipped 0.71% to $16.52. Platinum did better holding on to gains, and added 0.02% to finish last week at $968.20 per ounce. </p>"

Shanghai's CSI 300 index has gained 0.48%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is up 0.22%, and Australia's S&P ASX is up 0.90%. Trading has yet to open on Wall Street or in Europe, but the futures markets are showing gains there, too. Japanese markets will be closed today for a public holiday.</p><p>The US dollar and gold have both gained in the day's early trading. The dollar index has risen to 102.330, and the trend appears upwards. The GBP/USD is down to 1.2176, a sharp loss of 0.90% for sterling, and the USD/JPY is up at 117.39, a gain of 0.32% for the US dollar. The dollar has also gained against the Canadian currency, putting the USD/CAD at 1.3258.</p><p>The Euro and Swiss franc are both basically flat today. The EUR/USD is up a slight 0.06%, to 1.0538, while the USD/CHF is stable at 1.0181.</p><p>Gold is currently priced at $1,173.98, up 0.12% from last week, and platinum has gained 0.50% to $973.00. Silver remains down, at $16.50. The gains in gold and platinum came as investors sought a hedge for uncertainty, which brings us to oil.</p><p>Oil prices are down today, by about a half percentage point. The drop comes as traders grow skeptical about the efficacy of the OPEC production cutback plan, despite Saudi and Kuwaiti adherence to the new quotas. Iran, Libya, and Nigeria – all OPEC members – were all exempted from the plan, and all three are working hard to increase production. At the same time, US shale field oil producers have increased the active rig count again, for the tenth straight week in a row. Oil market traders fear that if the lower OPEC quotas succeed in boosting prices, the US shale fields will simply take up the slack. There is real doubt about whether or not the lower quotas will hold.</p><p>All of that brought crude oil prices down. The global trading benchmark grade, Brent crude, is selling at $56.80 per barrel, and the US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is priced at $53.67.</p><p>Looking ahead this week, we'll have Donald Trump's first press conference since the election; several speeches from Federal Reserve officials,including Fed chair Janet Yellen, and data on December's US retail sales and China's December trade numbers. It should be an interesting week.</p>"

The tech-heavy NASDAQ advanced 0.19%.</p><p>Starting with stocks, Wall Street saw both gains and retreats at yesterday's close. The Dow Jones slipped back from its record high, losing 0.38% for the day, while the S&P 500 fell 0.35%. The tech-heavy NASDAQ advanced 0.19%.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific region is winding down for the day, closing out a session that saw mostly losses. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.79% and the TOPIX dropped 0.71%. Both of those indexes fell as the Japanese yen saw gains, a common pattern in that export-dependent country. In China, markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai showed a sharp divergence. The Hang Seng gained 0.83%, but the CSI 300 in Shanghai fell 0.17%. Australia's S&P ASX lost 0.80% for the day.</p><p>Among currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc posted gains on safe haven demand. The USD/JPY pair is down to 115.94, and the USD/CHF has retreated to 1.0127. The dollar slipped against Euro, too, as the EUR/USD rose to 1.0601. The pound sterling lost ground, after comments by Prime Minister May renewed concerns about the timing, pace, and effect of implementing the Brexit policy. The GBP/USD is down to 1.2139.</p><p>In the metals markets, gold is gaining ground on the same safe haven demand that his helping out the yen and the franc. Gold is currently priced at $1,184.46 per ounce. Gold dropped below the $1,200 mark on November 23. It seems that the move to precious metals wasn't transferrable to metals other than gold, as silver and platinum are down, losing almost as much overnight as gold gained. Silver is selling for $16.65 per ounce, and platinum for $970.76.</p><p>Oil prices have recovered about a tenth of a percent, after a sharp overnight drop. Brent, the global benchmark grade, is selling at $54.97 per barrel, and WTI for $52.05. Oil prices are under pressure from traders' doubts that the OPEC agreement to curtail production and boost prices will be as effective as the hype, and from increased drilling activity in the US and Canada. Additionally, the US government in a surprise move released 8 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for sale this month. While this is a temporary factor, it is definitely bearish for the North American oil markets.</p><p>That's the trading news this morning. Have a great day in the markets!</p>"

                      "text": "<p>In the markets today, the US dollar is generally up, mostly due to weakness in the pound and Euro. The pound is facing pressure from the upcoming Brexit; British PM Theresa May is scheduled to speak tomorrow, and she is expected to give some details on her plans for implementing the separation of the UK from the EU. Investors are worried that she'll opt for the 'hard' Brexit, a sharp and sudden break, and that markets will reach with chaos until new immigration, trade, and financial agreements are forged.</p><p>Those worries pushed the GBP/USD down to 1.2055, and the EUR/USD down to 1.0593. The USD/JPY, on the other hand, has shown weakness for the dollar – the pair has dipped to 114.16, a loss of nearly a third of a percent as haven demand boosts the Japanese yen over the US dollar. Against the other majors, the dollar is holding steady – the USD/ CHF is up to 1.0121, the USD/CAD is up to 1.3140, and the AUD/USD is down to 0.7474.</p><p>Some of these currency moves are having the expected impact in the financial markets. The weaker pound is giving a lift to stocks in London, where companies respond well to any factor that makes exports cheaper. The FTSE 100 is up 0.095 today. In Japan, however, also export dependent, the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX index have lost 1% and 0.92% respectively. Stocks are also down in China and Continental Europe. The Hang Seng fell 0.96%, the CSI 300 dipped 0.01%, the DAX fell 0.64%, and the CAC 40 is down 0.63%.</p><p>US markets are closed today, for the Martin Luther King public holiday. Wall Street's trading will resume tomorrow.</p><p>In the commodity markets, oil prices are edging down. It's becoming clear to investors that the OPEC agreement to cut production and boost prices may not hold up. Even the Saudi Energy Minister has said that the agreement is unlikely to be extended beyond six months. With that in mind, Brent crude edged down to $55.28 per barrel and WTI has slipped to $52.21.</p><p>Precious metals are picking up the slack, gaining from the same haven demand that has boosted the Japanese yen. Gold has broken above $1,200, and is now selling at $1,203.73 per ounce, silver is up to $16.85, and platinum is steady at $984.95.</p>"
