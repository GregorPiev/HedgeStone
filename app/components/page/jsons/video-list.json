The S&P also lost 0.3% on the day and dipped 1.2% for the week. The NASDAQ retreated 0.9% on Friday and dropped 1.9% from a week ago. In Europe, trading was more vigorous, despite investors’ worries over the suspension of the Brexit campaign caused by the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, who was supportive of the decision to stay in next week’s referendum. The FTSE soared 1.2% on Friday but slid 1.5% from a week ago. The DAX advanced 0.8% and declined 2.1% overall on the week. The SMI jumped 1.0% on the day and, like other indices, slumped 2.6% since the previous Friday.

A former Bank of Japan official has stated that if the market turbulence proves temporary, and the yen gives back some of its gains, than the central bank can hold off on another stimulus effort. The statement added that Japan reserves the right to intervene in the currency markets to prevent the yen from appreciating too much, as a stronger yen is a severe drag on Japan's export dominated economy. Such a move would be strongly opposed by Washington, and market watchers are skeptical that Tokyo would follow through. The BoJ next meets to review rates and monetary policy at the end of July, but there is speculation that the bank will hold an emergency session sooner."

The yen is now near 2-year highs against the dollar, as the USD/JPY is trading at 102.39. It actually touched 99 on Friday, but has eased back and it may be that the yen is the first major to find a post-Brexit trading level.

Crude dropped initially after the vote, getting down to the $47 handle yesterday, but has now rebounded. US West Texas Intermediate is trading for $48.53 per barrel and Brent is up to $49.21.</p><p>The higher prices come as the American Petroleum Institute showed US stocks declining by nearly 3.9 million barrels, including a 1.2 million barrel drop at the States' largest oil storage and distribution facility in Cushing, Oklahoma. Another boost to crude came from Norway, where 7500 oil and gas workers in one of Europe's largest oil producers are threatening to go strike starting Saturday, over a new wage and labor deal.</p><p>It's important to remember that these factors, as well as other recent news that pushed oil up slightly, are only partly compensating for the underlying weak market fundamentals that have been impacting oil trading. OPEC and Russia are still producing at record levels; US fracking and shale producers have grown more efficient in the face of lower prices and learned how to maintain production while reducing the number of active rigs; global storage facilities are still near record levels; demand is weak in major consumers such as China; and the International Energy Agency is predicting a global oversupply averaging 1.5 million barrels per day looking ahead through 2017. In short, nothing has changed among the basic reasons why oil prices fell in the first place. Look for continued volatility in the oil markets.</p><p>The real winner in the post-Brexit market chaos has been gold. The metal is near a two-year high, despite easing back after reaching $1,362 last Friday. Gold is currently trading at $1,321.15 per ounce, putting it up about 25% for the year to date. Haven asset demand has fueled the metal's gains.</p><p>Silver has also gained, for the same reasons and almost as dramatically. It's selling at $18.31 per ounce, also a two-year high. Platinum, which like silver has industrial demand that has been swamped by asset trading, is now going for $989.20.</p>"

Cable's sharp drop seems to have halted, and the currency appears to have leveled off (with the natural daily volatility, of course) with the GBP/USD pair now at 1.3388. This is still very close to the 31-year low levels the pound reached last Friday.</p><p>The US dollar, which made strong gains among the major currencies as the pound fell, is generally holding its position. The EUR/USD, which had dipped as low as 1.09, is now at 1.1101, the USD/CHF is up slightly at 0.9806, and the USD/JPY has been fairly steady this week, having remained in the 102 range since Monday and trading now at 102.58. The yen gained sharply on safe haven trading after the vote.</p><p>It may be hard to see the overall strength of the dollar by looking at the individual currency pairs, with their constant shifts and changes. The US dollar index provides a big-picture view of the greenback by comparing it to a basket of trade-weighted currencies. The index now stands at 95.911 and is trending upwards. The index peaked at 96.544 on June 27, and while it has eased it is still at a 3-month high level.</p>"

The metal touched a high last Friday, at $1,360 per ounce, and has since pulled back to $1,315.65. Even accounting for that, gold is still $60 higher than before the Brexit vote, making a gain of 4.5%. Overall, gold has appreciated more than 20% since January 1, making this its best first half in more than ten years.</p><p>Silver and platinum have also made gains. Silver is trading at $18.41 per ounce, and is challenging the $18.50 level. Some analysts expect that it will break that resistance in the near future and possibly climb as high as $25. Platinum has broken above $1,000 for the first time since June 9, and is now trading at $1,007.55.<br />Oil declined in trading right after the British results came in, falling to the $47 handle, but has since regained the lost value. Crude picked up nearly 4% overnight as investor fears over the Brexit have eased and a combination of data releases and news reports have eased worries over supply issues. Currently, the US West Texas Intermediate benchmark price stands at $49.41 per barrel and the global markets' Brent price is at an even $50.</p><p>On the supply side, the official US report on oil inventories showed that crude stocks fell by 4.1 million barrels last week, beating early expectations by a wide margin. In addition, talks between the Nigerian government and guerillas in the Niger Delta are showing signs of success which may portend a resumption of Nigerian oil production and export.</p><p>It's important to remember that despite the positive news regarding supply, there is still a tremendous oversupply in global oil markets. Worldwide, production is exceeding demand by about 1 million barrels per day, and oil storage facilities around the world are nearing their maximum capacity. In the US, oil inventories total 526.6 million barrels, an 80-year high level for this time of year. Despite day-to-day or week-to-week fluctuations, this is the basic supply and demand issue that is dominating oil markets right now and holding prices down.</p>"

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 is up 0.48% and the TOPIX has gained 0.41%. The rally here comes despite a poor industrial production report, which showed May's output plunging 2.3%. Japanese stocks may be reflecting an adjustment to the now-stronger yen, an acceptance of its new level in the 102 range, and an easing of fears that the currency could strengthen further. The Japanese markets are highly sensitive to exports, which are negatively impacted when the yen appreciates.</p><p>In China, the CSI 300 index managed to squeak out a 0.14% gain for the day, while the Hang Seng picked up 1.74%. Australia's Sj&P ASX gained 1.70%. It's important to remember that even though the Asian markets have posted gains over the last several days, they are all still down significantly for the month of June.</p><p>From the US, there have been some mixed economic reports. Housing data missed expectations with a 3.7% decline in pending home sales, and the April data was revised downwards. Personal spending, however, showed a rise in May of 0.4% and April's number was revised upward slightly to 1.1%. The rise in spending came even as personal income rose at a slower pace than expected.</p><p>In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished yesterday with a gain of 1.54%, the Sj&P 500 ended up 1.70%, and the NASDAQ picked up 1.86%. While all three are still down for the month of June, the Dow and the Sj&P are showing year-over-year gains.</p><p>In Europe, the main indexes had an excellent day yesterday, with the FTSE 100 in London recouping all of its losses since the Brexit vote. The FTSE gained 3.58% yesterday, and is up 2% for the month. The DAX gained 1.75% and the CAC 40 advanced 2.60%. Both are down for June.</p>"

Investors, meantime, are trying to work out the odds that Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will increase monetary easing, or to divine when, if ever, the US Federal Reserve will hike rates again.</p><p>In the US, markets will reopen today after a long holiday weekend. Happy Independence Day to our friends in the States!<br />In Europe, market watchers are focused on the Italian banking sector. The major Italian banks are basically insolvent, weighed down by an enormous backlog of bad loans, and unable to continue operations without a bailout. Italy's historical method of dealing with a situation like this was to devalue the currency, bail out the banks, and let everyone deal with the new exchange rate. That option is not available in the Euro regime.</p><p>The problem, however, is that after the Greek debacle, northern European countries are in no mood to permit any further bailouts. Greece was the world's 44th largest economy, and bailing them out nearly tore apart the Eurozone. Italy is the world's 8th largest economy. Europe hasn't got the resources to make this bailout happen, even if the political will did exist.</p><p>In the meantime, in the UK, the Bank of England's Governor has hinted that the central bank may push a monetary stimulus policy over the summer, to deal with the Brexit fallout.</p><p>The European markets reflected the gloom, with FTSE in London losing 0.84%, the DAX falling 0.69%, and the CAC 40 dropping 0.91%.<br />In the Asia-Pacific markets, Australia made the headlines. The Reserve Bank of Australia announced its decision to hold interest rates steady at their record low of 1.75%. The Bank's board cited the ongoing market volatility as well as the Parliamentary issues after the indecisive Aussie Federal elections. Economic data releases from Down Under were not bad, showing a 1% rise in exports and 0.2% gain in retail sales for the month of May.</p><p>In the stock markets, Tokyo reflected the stronger yen with a 0.66% drop in the Nikkei 225. The CSI 300 in Shanghai gained 0.05%, but the Hang Seng fell 0.71%. Australia's Sj&P ASX lost 1.02%.</p>"

Sterling lost nearly 2.5%, bringing the GBP/USD pair down to 1.2920.</p><p>The US dollar and the Japanese yen, on the other hand, both benefited as investors pulled out of risk assets and looked for safe havens. The dollar rose against all of its major peers except the yen, while the USD/JPY pair dropped to 100.95.

This is the highest level for gold in 33 months.</p><p>A combination of factors pushed oil prices down overnight. Indications from the OPEC countries showed that the cartel's June production hit a record high, while reports from the US indicated that the major storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma &ndash; already filled to historically high levels &ndash; experienced an unexpected build in stocks last week.</p><p>Both items renewed fears of the global supply glut in the oil markets. Those fears are justified; oil supplies remain at record high levels, and demand has not been strong enough to cut into them. Additionally, producers are pumping about 1 million barrels per day more than demand requires.</p><p>The result is obvious to anyone who took Econ 101 &ndash; supply and demand in this case pushes the prices down.

Most financial analysts and economists expect that the UK will slip into at least a mild recession in the near future, as the Brexit policy is implemented.</p><p>Also hurting markets in Europe are the travails of the Italian banks, which have more non-performing loans than they are capable of carrying on the books. Italy has no chance of getting a Greek-style bailout, however, and it is the world's 8th largest economy. We're about to get a close up view of a major bank implosion with no one willing or able to help. Should be interesting.</p><p>The prospect is not pleasing to investors.

A gloomy economic data release did not help the markets any, as factory orders for May fell 1% - worse than the 0.8% expectation &ndash; and orders for durable goods dropped 2.3%. Tesla Motors, the electric luxury car makers, showed a share price loss of 1.2%, after reports of \"autopilot failures\" resulting in fatal accidents. Hmm.</p>"

The Aussie is also higher, at 0.7518, the USD/CHF has edged down to 0.9749, and the USD/CAD retreated to 1.2956. The US dollar index, the broader measure of the dollar against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, slipped 0.2% to 96.013.</p><p>The pound and the yen made bigger news. The pound dipped to another 31-year low, actually getting below the $1.28 level before bumping back up to its current $1.2982. Sterling's drop comes as investors are dropping the currency on fears that Britain, and then Europe, could tip into recession during the upcoming implantation of the Brexit. The British currency has taken the harder hit, falling 15% since the referendum.</p><p>While the dollar gained strength on the weakness the pound and Euro, the yen saw stronger gains. The Japanese currency has appreciated some 5% against the dollar, getting a boost from its role as a safe haven asset. The yen's reputation comes from Japan's institutional stability, but ironically its gains tend to undermine its haven asset role by depressing Japanese exports and then consequently hurting Japanese equities. Right now, the USD/JPY is trading at 100.76, and trending downwards. The yen has not been this strong since November of 2013 &ndash; 31 months ago.</p><p>It's important to note that the yen has been appreciating for the last six months. For the first half of this year, global economies have been showing signs of slowing, and investors have been seeking haven assets. The yen, as well as gold, has strengthened on that sentiment, and Japanese policy makers are having difficulty countering it.</p>"

The inventory draws as the summer driving season in the US reaches its height, increasing demand for petroleum products. The drawdown report came from the trade group American Petroleum Institute, and showed a reduction of 6.7 million barrels.</p><p>The downward pressures on oil prices haven't relented, however. Stockpiles of refined products remain high, and slowing economic growth with its tempered demand for oil has weighed on traders. In light of this, Brent crude is selling for $48.89 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate is going for $47.57.</p><p>Precious metals are up, gaining on their reputation as haven assets while investors are pulling out of riskier instruments such as oil and equities.

Bank stocks are feeling serious pressure, as the German banking giant Deutsche Bank is scrambling for funds to avoid insolvency, Credit Suisse's share price has hit an all-time low, and the Italian banks are in even worse shape, with 17% of their outstanding loans being non-performing. A full blown banking crisis is taking shape in Europe, and it's only a matter of time before it can no longer be kicked down the road.</p><p>Right now, the FTSE in London is up 1.18%, the DAX is up 0.80%, and the CAC 40 is up 1.03%. Yesterday, they lost 1.2%, 1.7%, and 1.9% respectively. It will likely be an interesting day for the European equity markets.</p><p>As today's session comes to an end in the Asia-Pacific region, the major indexes are decidedly mixed. Tokyo is down, and no surprise given the yen's appreciation and Japan's sensitivity to exports. The Nikkei 225 lost 0.67% and the TOPIX fell 0.66%. China's CSI 300 rose towards the end of trading, but still finished with a loss of 0.21%. The Hang Seng, however, put up a gain of 1.07%. Australia's Sj&P ASX also gained, 0.59%.</p><p>In New York, the US markets opened to losses yesterday but rallied posted gains by session's end. The DJIA gained 0.44%, the Sj&P 500 advanced 0.54%, and the NASDAQ was up by 0.75%. These gains came despite a data release showing that the US trade deficit increased to $41.14 billion in May, well over the expectation for $40 billion. The widening trade deficit can be traced to the dollar's recent gains making US exports more expensive overseas.</p><p>Investors had a chance to look over the Fed's June FOMC minutes, and the futures traders lowered the odds of an interest rate hike before December to just 12%. That's down from 44% before the Brexit vote. It may be that they are being generous; a casual glance a calendar should make it obvious that there will be no further rate hike this year; with the election coming up in November, the Fed will not move until the next Administration is sworn in.</p>"

Gold, silver, and platinum have all recouped their losses, and then some, as investors remain cautious and continue to buy haven assets.</p><p>Gold is currently selling for $1,366.33 per ounce, silver for $20.35, and platinum for $1,097.35. All three metals are higher than they were before the release of the jobs report.</p><p>Copper, an important industrial metal and a useful proxy for the industrial metals market, continue to slide and is now down to $2.12 per pound.<br />Oil prices are also falling, with the drops mainly driven by continued worries about supply and demand &ndash; global supplies remain high while demand is only moderate, and on a global level daily production is exceeding demand by about 1 million barrels. It's a situation made for low prices.</p><p>It's not helped any by the OPEC cartel's deliberate strategy of overproduction in pursuit of market share despite lower prices. Saudi Arabia &ndash; the largest producer and exporter in OPEC &ndash; initiated the strategy about two years ago, with several objectives in mind. They were looking to push high cost North American shale and tar sand producers out of business; they were looking to increase Asian and North American market share; they were meeting the production challenge posed by Russia; and they hoped that low prices would put pressure on their geopolitical rival in Iran. To a large extent, the Saudis have achieved these goals.</p><p>It's an interesting background to an oil market in which crude is once again approaching the $45 mark. Overall, prices this year have paralleled the pattern we saw last year, with an increase in spring, a plateau in June, and drop in July. It remains to be seen in that parallel will hold.<br />At the end of last week's trading, Brent crude was selling for $46.76 per barrel and WTI was going for $45.41.</p>"

The report was widely anticipated, as last month's jobs numbers were nothing less than atrocious.</p><p>The June numbers were better, far better. At 287,000 jobs created, the report exceeded expectations by more than 100,000 and showed the highest monthly increase since last October.</p><p>One point of caution in lauding the numbers: May's already bad result was revised further downwards, to just 11,000, and the three month moving average, even with the excellent June print, is only 147,000, actually lower than this time last year.</p><p>The unemployment rate edged up slightly, as did the labor force participation rate. A close look at the demographics of the jobs gains shows that 90% of all the new jobs went to workers over age 55. This may be a sign that aging workers are deferring retirement, or that employers are seeking experience first. In either case, it's a hard blow to younger workers.</p><p>Markets liked the news, however, and the overall impression of a growing US jobs market. The Dow gained 1.40%, the S&amp;P 500 picked up 1.53%, and the NASDAQ advanced 1.64%.</p><p>In Europe, there was also a positive reaction, with the FTSE 100 showing a pickup of 0.87%, the DAX gaining 2.24%, and the CAC 40 showing a rise of 1.77%.<br />Asian markets had closed before the release, and showed losses. The Japanese markets were especially hard hit, as the stronger yen weighed on them. The Nikkei 225 lost 1.11% and the TOPIX fell 1.32%. The Hang Seng lost 0.69% and the CSI 300 in Shanghai dropped 0.55%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX managed to squeak out a gain of 0.05%.</p>"

The NZD/USD retreated from recent 14-month highs to trade at 0.7244 and the AUD/USD fell to 0.7539.</p><p>The Japanese yen, which has posted strong gains recently on safe haven trading during market uncertainty, also slipped, losing 1.4% against the dollar in the wake of Japan's parliamentary election. PM Abe's win there raises the chance that Japan may see additional stimulus measures. The USD/JPY is currently trading at 101.95. The yen also fell against the Euro, bringing the EUR/JPY to 112.42.</p><p>The British pound has taken a heavy beating in the aftermath of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, losing nearly 10% against the dollar since the June 23 referendum. Sterling appeared to have stabilized a bit recently, however, and the currency actually edged up overnight. Those gains are gone now, and the GBP/USD has slipped again to 1.2884.

The metal is facing a bit of uncertainty as to the US Federal Reserve's future rate policy, especially in light of the awful May jobs report and the strong June report. The UK's EU vote and the consequent market turmoil tended to boost gold, as does expectations that there will be additional monetary stimulus in the EU and UK.</p><p>Overall, gold remains a bullish prospect, having gained nearly 30% year-to-date.

Silver is selling for $20.36 per ounce and platinum for $1,095.27. All three precious metals have gained on haven trading as investors seek safe assets and a hedge against inflation.</p>"

The strong win for PM Abe's party in the parliament, and the possibility that he may now be able to push through his economic stimulus policies, also helped to boost the stock markets.</p><p>In China, a consumer inflation measure came in lower than the government's target rate, which may indicate weak demand for goods and services.

Australia's S&amp;P ASX gained 2.04%.</p><p>European markets are taking a \"wait and see\" attitude to the Bank of England, which may pursue a monetary easing policy for economic stimulus purposes.

The DAX is up 1.27%, and the CAC 40 has gained 1.08%.</p><p>US markets are not open yet, but got a boost on Friday from the strong June jobs report. The report showed a gain of 287,000 jobs created for the month, but it also revised the May numbers down to an anemic 11,000. Taken together, the May and June reports show that the economy was performing at its average rate for the last 6 months, and the wide divergence between the reports is likely a statistical fluke.</p><p>Market traders remain unconvinced that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again this year, despite the jobs situation, and have priced in only a 24% chance of a rate hike by December. A glance at the US election calendar, however, should convince anyone that 24% is far too high &ndash; Janet Yellen is not likely to take any move that could unbalance the November elections.

Sometimes a rising tide will lift every boat.</p><p>The combination of the upbeat US jobs report and expectations for further monetary stimulus efforts in Britain, the EU, and Japan helped fuel the Asian markets. In Tokyo, the weaker yen also helped, and the Nikkei 225 rose 2.46%. The TOPIX also rose, showing a gain of 2.38%. Investors are more sanguine of Japanese markets now that PM Abe has a clearer path toward implementing his 10 trillion yen stimulus package.</p><p>In China, the CSI 300 index rose 1.46% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.94%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX joined in the general gains, and posted an increase of 0.30%.<br />European markets ended well yesterday, after the British Tories chose Theresa May, currently the Home Secretary, to the Conservative Party leadership. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to step down in coming days, at which point the Queen will formally ask May, the new majority leader in the Commons, to form a government. May is widely expected to maintain the UK's cordial trade relations with the EU as she navigates the complicated procedure for pulling Britain out of the single market.</p><p>Both the pound and the Euro rose on news of her planned succession. It's a rare instance of most parties being pleased by a result &ndash; \"Remain\" supporters know that she is in favor of close ties with the EU, while \"Leave\" supporters know that she'll invoke the exit clauses of the Maastrict Treaty.</p><p>Markets reflected the happy feelings. In London, the FTSE closed 1.40% higher, the DAX gained 2.12%, and the CAC 40 advanced 1.76%.<br />In the US, Wall Street saw some record closing. The S&amp;P 500 set an intraday record high during the session, and closed with a gain of 0.34%. The Dow gained 0.44%, and the NASDAQ picked up 0.64%.</p><p>Market watchers are feeling sanguine after the strong June jobs report, and are pricing in increased odds &ndash; at 30% &ndash; of a Fed rate hike by December this year. Still, with the US election coming up, most futures traders doubt that the Fed will move before next January's inauguration of the next President.</p>"

The IEA expects inventories to continue rising in June, including oil stored on tankers at sea.</p><p>Price-wise, all of this has Brent at $47.72 per barrel, while the US benchmark WTI is selling for $46.20.</p><p>Oil is generally considered a risk asset. Gold, on the other hand, is used as a safe haven by investors when riskier assets are showing too much volatility. Gold tends to advance when other markets go haywire, and to drop on news of stability.</p><p>Gold took such a hit yesterday, falling to two-week lows on the news about Theresa May's planned succession to 10 Downing Street. Gold fell as low as $1,330 before ticking back up to $1,340.90, for a recoup of about half the total loss. The yellow metal is still up about 27% for the year to date.</p><p>Silver has also done well, and is selling for $20.43 per ounce. Silver has important industrial uses that gold lacks, so it is instructive to compare it with copper. Copper has also gained, reaching $2.24 per pound, for a 4% gain this week.</p>"

That rally is showing signs of a slowdown. In their most recent sessions, both the American and Asian indexes, while they closed with daily gains, showed the same pattern of starting high and falling during the trading day. European stocks are opening to mixed results and volatility in today's session.</p><p>In the US, part of the pushback comes from the Federal Reserve, whose members have been hinting that despite the strong June jobs report the Fed will not likely rush to raise rates. The hints, while they had a market impact, were not exactly unanticipated; traders put the likelihood of a rate hike this year at less than 50%. Many analysts, including this writer, believe that the US election cycle effectively precludes any rate hike before February of next year.</p><p>Taking a look at the market numbers, the Dow Jones gained 0.66% yesterday, while the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ both gained 0.70%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up by 0.84% in today's trading, the Hang Seng had gained 0.46%, and the CSI 300 in Shanghai was up 0.30%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX gained 0.66%.</p><p>The UK decision to leave the EU fed uncertainty in the markets, but with the selection of Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed to the Premiership, things seem to be calming down in Britain. May has supported the Remain camp, but is on record saying, after the vote, that \"Brexit means Brexit.\" She is expected to take a slow and cautious course while invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty.</p><p>In the meantime, European investors are wary today, and markets are volatile. The FTSE 100 in London has been up and down; it is currently up 0.07%. The DAX has fallen 0.08%, and the CAC 40 is up 0.19%.</p><p>Market traders will be watching May's selection for Chancellor of the Exchequer, the British finance minister, for clues as to how she will trigger the mechanics of the Brexit.</p>"

Any gains are likely to be modest, as fears mount that the oversupply issues are simply not going away.</p><p>Reports from the US showed that American stockpiles declined less than expected last week, while storage inventories of gasoline and other refined products increased by the most since January. It's an ominous sign of weak demand in the busy summer driving season.</p><p>In another sign of the ongoing supply glut, nine major oil tankers are simply sitting in the North Sea, keeping some 9 million barrels of crude in \"floating storage.\" This is up 2 million barrels from May, and is only a drop in the 95 million barrel bucket of crude oil stored on tankers at sea worldwide. It's the highest volume stored this way since the 2009 recession.</p><p>Perhaps a bigger problem than just the volume of crude oil at sea is that most of the floating cargoes are not on contract &ndash; they haven't got buyers yet. With demand softening in Europe and China, that situation is not likely to change.</p><p>What all of this means for traders is the likelihood of lower prices for at least the near future, despite today's slight uptick.

The electoral cycle effectively precludes any Fed action before November, and simple inertial makes it unlikely that there will be any further monetary policy changes &ndash; easing or tightening &ndash; before the next Presidential Administration is sworn in at the end of January.</p><p>In the meantime, the US stock markets will face another test this coming week with the regular release of Q2 company earnings reports. Investors will be watching closely for evidence of the Brexit vote's impact on the bottom line.</p><p>In the UK, the Bank of England kept key rates steady last week at 0.5%, taking a cautious path in the wake of the Brexit vote. The BoE did hind that it could act at its next meeting in August &ndash; a string of conditional tense verbiage there &ndash; but will decide when the data from the next Quarterly Inflation Report become available.</p><p>With the background there, a look at market numbers shows mixed results last Friday.

Turkey is not a major oil producer; rather, it is a conduit for other Middle Eastern countries' energy, and the quick defeat of the coup, combined with the Turkish government's need for an income stream, promised stability and reliability in the flow of oil and oil products through Turkey.</p><p>The bigger factors affecting crude oil prices are the usual ones: supply and demand. Gasoline inventories in the US are reaching max storage capacity, and recently five tankers full of fuel have been turned away from New York harbor; they could not unload because there was nowhere to put the gasoline. It's the summer driving season in the US, normally the time of peak demand for gasoline, but so far that demand has been weak and has not dented the oversupply.</p><p>The oversupply of gasoline will impact demand for crude oil, as refiners will have less need for crude to work with, especially with US crude oil stocks also near record levels. The oversupply has industry analysts predicting that crude oil prices could dip back to $40 per barrel.</p><p>Additional bad news for oil bulls comes from the supply side. There were a number of supply disruption this spring and early summer, but those events are clearing up. The wildfires that temporarily shut down the Alberta oil sands are out, and Canada's production is returning to normal. Nigeria has resumed output after coming to an agreement with militants in the Niger Delta, and Libya has said that the state oil company may be able to increase exports later this month. Finally, OPEC's core Gulf nations are producing oil at record levels. With storage facilities full, and global supply exceeding demand, it is not an environment that encourages a long-term rise in prices.</p><p>With that as the background, we see that Brent crude, the global trading benchmark, is at $47.69, while the US benchmark, WTI, is selling for $45.98 per barrel.</p>"

The same report, however, also showed some ominous factors for oil bulls going forward: a buildup in gasoline stocks of more than 900,000 barrels, and build (within the overall drawdown of stocks) at the Cushing storage facility of almost 190,000 barrels of crude. The Cushing facility is the US' largest oil storage depot, and it is already near its maximum capacity.

Qualcomm, an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company, published an unexpectedly good forecast and ended the trading day in the green.</p><p>European Market. Lufthansa did poorly on Thursday, dropping because it had diminished its 2016 profit forecast. EasyJet showed bad quarterly revenue and declined as well. It also refused to make predictions concerning its full-year revenue, viewing its future as uncertain due to the recent terrorists attack and the failed attempt to overthrow government in Turkey.

At Friday's close, gold finished the week down 0.26%, marking its second consecutive weekly loss. Gold hasn't had two weeks in a row of losses since May.</p><p>Despite the recent losses, gold is still above $1,300. It's currently selling for $1,316.35 per ounce, and is up about 24% for the year-to-date. The metal has been boosted by lower expectations for a US Federal Reserve rate hike and by concerns over global economic conditions.</p><p>Silver and platinum have been showing similar price patterns, and are also down from recent highs. Silver is trading for $19.57 per ounce, down from its peak above $20 but still up 41% for the year. Platinum is selling for $1,074.75, a gain of 20% year-to-date.</p><p>We've been talking in the space for a while about oil market supply and demand issues. This may sound basic, and it is, but it has been the main driver for prices for some time. Simply put, due to overproduction on a tremendous scale there has been a supply glut in the markets for nearly two years now. A supply glut of that magnitude cannot help but push prices down, especially when shaky global economic conditions are keeping demand modest at best.</p><p>However, it is the summer driving season in the US, and higher demand, combined with production cuts spurred by lower prices, finally started making a dent in the US crude oil stockpiles. There has been hope among oil traders that the supply draws and lower production together could start pushing prices back up. There may be a brief bump to that effect, but don't bet too much on it. Demand is about to fall.</p><p>Oil demand in the US is seasonal, and August/September are typically low-demand months. People are returning from vacations, and driving less. In response, refineries use less oil. And it's important to note that while overall US crude supplies have drawn down somewhat, US gasoline inventories have actually risen, due to weak demand even for the driving season. Expect the refiners to start their maintenance cycle early this year.</p><p>So much for the demand side. On the production side, the OPEC countries have been making up for the States' slack with a production increase to 32.9 million barrels per day in June. Russia, the largest non-OPEC supplier, is expected to increase output by nearly 600,000 barrels per day by 2019, and even in the States there are signs that production may increase soon. US drillers have brought an additional 41 rigs online in the last month.</p><p>With that background, the slipping oil prices start to make more sense. US crude, the WTI benchmark price, is down to $44.04 per barrel and Brent, the global trading benchmark, has fallen to $45.58 per barrel. Both prices are trending downwards.</p>"

Telecom and utility companies helped drive the market gains, with Q2 earnings reports that exceeded the forecasts. Yahoo and Verizon were both among the winners, with share prices advancing on leaked news that Verizon would offer $5 billion to purchase Yahoo. Both companies declined to comment on the news.</p><p>Recent upbeat economic reports have also buoyed US markets. The reports showed US economic reliance in the face of global conditions that are flat or flashing red. The June jobs reports, retail sales numbers, and a measure of the service industries have all beaten the forecasts. One positive result of this: investors are more sanguine now that the Federal Reserve will indeed raise interest rates again before the end of the year. The Fed will meet this month, and while traders have only priced in less than a 10% chance of hike now, they put the odds by December at 45%. A glance at the US election cycle calendar should be enough to disabuse anyone of that notion, however; the election is on November 8, and the new Presidential Administration will take office on January 20. Don't expect the Fed to act before February.</p><p>In Asia, the main markets were mixed. Tokyo's markets dipped slightly, while Chinese and Australian markets rose. The Nikkei 225 showed a drop of 0.04%, while the TOPIX dipped 0.16%. In Shanghai, the CSI 300 gained 0.18% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.13%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX added 0.64%.</p><p>Nintendo seems to have been the biggest weight on Tokyo's stocks. The game company lost 18% after it announced that his has only a limited stake in the wildly popular Pokemon Go app, and that the financial impact of the app on the company's bottom line would be modest. At the same time, Nintendo is forecast to announce an annual profit of 35 billion yen, up from 16.5 billion last year. It's an interesting definition of a limited impact.</p><p>In Europe, the main indexes are opening to gains today. London's FTSE 100 is up by 0.27%, despite some gloomy reports on the UK service and manufacturing sectors. Germany's DAX is up 0.86%, and the French CAC 40 has gained 0.70%.</p>"

The increase in refined products, combined with low demand, bodes ill for future oil prices, as refiners will have less need of crude in the winter months.</p><p>Overall, oil prices are down 15% from their June peak. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark grade, is selling for $42.68 per barrel. Brent crude, the global trading benchmark, is going for $44.38.</p>"

Tokyo, however, saw strong gains in the markets after PM Abe announced a large stimulus package &ndash; more than 28 trillion yen, well over expectations for 10 to 20 trillion yen &ndash; to try and boost the Japanese economy. The Nikkei reacted with a closing gain of 1.72%, while the TOPIX added 1.13%.</p><p>The announcement of the stimulus plan puts pressure on the Bank of Japan, which holds its regular policy meeting tomorrow and Friday. BoJ is widely expected to increase its monetary easing policy when it releases its statement on Friday.</p><p>In the US, the stock markets had a mixed day yesterday, with the Dow losing 0.10%, the S&amp;P 500 picking up a modest 0.03%, and the NASDAQ gaining 0.24%.<br />Trading has been lighter than usual as investors are waiting to see the Federal Reserve will do. The Fed is wrapping up its regular policy meeting today, and will release its policy statement this evening. Fed chair Janet Yellen's statement will be carefully parsed, with an eye toward future interest rate policy. With the election coming in November, traders do not expect another rate hike this summer (the odds for September are only 25%), but December is still in play with markets pricing in a 42% chance of higher rates before the end of the year.</p><p>European markets opened to gains in early trading today, and are holding on to them. London's FTSE 100 is up 0.30%, the DAX is up 0.84%, and the CAC 40 has gained 1.46%.</p><p>The banking sector in Europe is under pressure, with Italian and Portuguese banks hoping for a bailout as happened in Greece. Even Germany is not immune, as Europe's banks are generally undercapitalized. Deutsche Bank reported a drop in net profits, to 20 million Euros, as well as a 20% reduction in Q2 revenues.

Gold hit a 28 month high level in the panic after the Brexit vote, so this past week's 2% slide didn't really hurt the investors much as the metal was still up about 25% for the year.

Gold finished with its second straight week of increases, giving it a 27% rally for the year to date. Gold is currently selling for $1,351.28 per ounce. Silver, also a traditional form of money and a haven asset, saw smaller gains, rising to $20.39 per ounce. Silver has gained over 9% for the month of July.</p><p>The big winner among the precious metals, however, was platinum, which jumped to $1,148.58 per ounce. The white metal has important industrial uses (in the catalytic converters that help control car emissions), is sensitive to ongoing labor disputes in South Africa, and has also gained as a haven from central banks' monetary easing. Platinum is up 28% for the year, giving it a slight edge over gold in terms of return on investment.</p><p>Oil, on the other hand, is moving the other direction, and has lost nearly 20% since the beginning of June. This puts the fuel on the path to an official bear market.</p><p>Supply and demand issues have dominated the oil markets lately, and even though much excess production is slowing down, global stockpiles are still nearly overflowing. It's estimated that there are more than 3 billion barrels of crude oil in stockpiles around the world. The persistent glut in supply has badly upset the market, and consistently defied predictions that oil markets will return to a normal balance between supply and demand.</p><p>In terms of price, we see WTI, the US trading benchmark, at $41.60 per barrel, and Brent, the global price, at $43.53.</p>"

The headline number of 1.2% was far below expectations; economists has predicted 2.6%, but the actual number was less than half that value. In another hit, the Q1 number was revised down to just 0.8%.</p><p>The next major data release coming up is the July non-farm payroll report, due out on Friday, August 5. The last two NFP releases were opposites &ndash; May's report was disastrously low, while June's report was unbelievably high. The two together matched the six month average. The forecast for July is for 180,000 jobs created, enough to meet the pace of population growth, but the poor GDP growth casts some doubt on that rosy prediction.</p><p>The gloomy news had immediate repercussions. The prospect of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike is now seen as much lower, and the US dollar dropped sharply in the markets.</p><p>US stocks finished Friday with mixed results. The Dow was down 0.13%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.16%, and the NASDAQ picked up 0.14%.</p><p>Bank of Japan also disappointed investors on Friday, when it refused to increase its monetary easing activities with further purchases of Japanese government bonds or by pushing interest rates deeper into negative territory. The BoJ announcement casts doubts, or at least concerns, over how the government plans to fund PM Abe's aggressive 28 trillion yen economic stimulus plan, and has spurred speculation that the central bank will resort to some form of simply printing money &ndash; so-called helicopter money &ndash; and releasing it into the general public.</p><p>Japanese stocks were volatile on Friday, but ended in positive territory, as the Nikkei 225 0.56% and the TOPIX added 1.20%. Australian stocks showed a similar pattern, and the S&amp;P ASX gained a modest 0.10%. In China, however, stocks were down. The Hang Seng lost 1.28%, and on the mainland Shanghai's CSI 300 fell 0.53%.</p><p>In Europe, markets were similarly volatile. London's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 both traded in the red during the session, but finished with gains of 0.05% and 0.44% respectively. The DAX was green all day, and ended 0.61% ahead.</p>"

Oversupply and indications of increasing US and OPEC production are combining to push prices down.</p><p>In the States, the number of active rigs for the fifth week in a row, and the eighth time in the last nine weeks. It's a likely a lagging response to the summer's bounce in oil prices &ndash; drillers sold product on higher futures prices which allows them to increase production despite a price decline now. The higher production, however, cuts into oil prices and that will depress production later.</p><p>Oil stockpiles are also high, underlining fears of global oversupply. Again, looking at the States, crude stocks increased by 1.67 million barrels two weeks ago, and are only slightly off their 97-year high of 543.4 million barrels from April. Petroleum product stocks are also up, as gasoline inventories rose to 241.5 million barrels.</p><p>Brent crude is below $43, selling at $42.98 right now, and WTI, the US benchmark grade, is selling for $41.12 per barrel. Expect the high stockpiles of refined products to keep crude oil demand weak and prices down, at least through the end of the year.</p><p>Gold hit a daily peak above $1,360 on Friday, as haven demand fueled purchases. The demand was spurred by the overall gloomy economic news, the slow growth in the US, and the BoJ decision not to push monetary easing right now. Precious metals all showed gains.</p><p>Right now, gold remains high but has eased slightly to $1,347.91 per ounce. Silver is selling for $20.52, and platinum for $1,147.56.</p>"

Corporate earnings are down worldwide, marking the fifth straight quarter of declines in the US. The slowing global economy is hurting sales figures in many industries, impacting the bottom lines.</p><p>Earnings in the States, with two thirds of the S&amp;P 500 members having reports so far, are down 3.3% from Q2 last year. Asia and Europe are in worse shape. Among companies in Asia that have announced results, earnings are down 19%, while Stoxx Europe 600 members have reported an average 14% decline so far.<br />The gloomy picture isn't relieved by growth forecasts, as the world economy is only predicted to grow by 2.9% this year. It's the lowest growth forecast since 2009. The US, EU, and China are expected to slow down this year, as are major emerging players such as Mexico.</p><p>Among the factors casting shadows on growth forecasts are the British decision to leave the EU, and the upcoming Brexit process; the US Presidential election in November, with widespread dismay at the available choice of candidates; and the increase in global terrorism. It's not a pretty picture.</p><p>The current data are not giving any better impression. In the US, Q2 Gross Domestic Product grew at an anemic 1.2% rate, and the Q1 figure was revised down to 0.8%. The poor GDP growth has put a damper on expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike; futures traders put the chance of an increase by September at just 12%, and have reduced the December chances to 33%.</p><p>The US stock markets responded with a mixed day on Friday, as the Dow lost 0.13%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.16%, and the NASDAQ edged up 0.14%.</p><p>In Asia, news from Japan and China was also disappointing. The Bank of Japan chose not to increase its monetary easing policies &ndash; not to increase government bond purchases or to push interest rates further negative. The decision came after PM Abe's government announced an aggressive economic stimulus package, totally 28 trillion yen and well above the 10 to 20 trillion yen expected. However, only some 7 trillion yen of the stimulus is expected to be direct fiscal measures, so investors are taking a wait and see approach to Japan's future monetary and economic policy.</p><p>In China, meantime, manufacturing data showed more reason for concern about the slowdown in the second largest global economy. The manufacturing PMI dipped to 49.9 for July, showing the first monthly contraction in five months.</p><p>Stock markets in Asia reacted to the news with mixed results. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 gained, advancing 0.40%, while the TOPIX fell 0.07%. China's CSI 300 index lost 0.85%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.09%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX gained 0.45%.</p><p>Turning to Europe, investors are waiting for Thursday's Bank of England policy decision announcement. BoE is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points &ndash; the first cut since 2009 &ndash; but not to increase bond buying.</p><p>The European equity markets opened to gains today, but have dipped since. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.04% and the CAC 40 has fallen 0.42%. The DAX is still up, by 0.29%.</p>"

The Dow fell 0.49%, the S&amp;P dropped 0.64%, and the NASDAQ lost 0.90%.</p><p>The losses came on the heels of Tuesday's data release showing that June incomes rose less than expected &ndash; only 0.2% &ndash; and that the savings rate fell to a one-year low. The data cast some shadows on the consumer sector of the US economy.</p><p>Tuesday's data, after last Friday's poor GDP print, have helped to push the odds of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike further down, with futures traders putting only a 40% chance of more monetary tightening this year. The gloomy outlook is a major factor behind the dollar's fall in the currency markets over the last few days.</p><p>In Japan, meantime, a lower-than-expected economic stimulus package pushed equities down and the yen up. Last week, PM Abe announced that his government would push a policy of stimulus for the faltering economy; rumors had the total amount of the plan at well over 20 trillion yen. The actual policy announcement this week, however, put the total stimulus at just 7 trillion yen, with only 4.6 trillion in direct government spending.</p><p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were not impressed. In Tokyo, the TOPIX is down 2.17% and the Nikkei 225 has fallen 1.88%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.76%, but on mainland China Shanghai's CSI 300 index managed to squeak out a gain of 0.14%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX is down 1.35%.</p><p>In Europe, markets were down yesterday and are opening to more losses in early trading today. London's FTSE 100 is down 0.02%, the DAX has lost 0.13%, and the CAC 40 has fallen 0.44%. These losses come as major European banks are feeling increased pressure from a combination of undercapitalization and an abundance of underperforming loans. Share prices of Deutsche Bank are down and Credit Suisse is managing to scrape out a small gain after losing more than 4% earlier this week.</p><p>Investors are waiting for Bank of England to release its interest rate decision on Thursday, the second such release since the Brexit vote. Expectations are for another cut.</p>"

Oil broke back above $40, and WTI, the US benchmark, is trading at $40.82 per barrel. Brent, the global market benchmark, is selling for $42.97.</p><p>The gains come after data showed that US crude and gasoline stockpiles fell last week, in the largest draw since April. Some analysts believe that this may mark a reversal of oil's price decline; however, it's important to note that while US refiners are ordering more crude, and drawing from stockpiles, and that distributors are drawing from gasoline stockpiles, demand is still weak and the refiners are starting early to switch from summer fuels to winter blends. The stockpile draws may just reflect that switch; the winter gasoline blends will be used starting in the fall, and the refiners will find the same bind they are in now: low demand, and large supplies of crude. The result could be continued low prices.</p><p>Gold prices declined yesterday, and continue to fall today, mostly in response to the stronger dollar. The drop marks the end of gold's longest rally in the last two months. The metal currently sells for $1,351.89 per ounce. Silver and platinum also declined, to $20.23 and $1,155.59 respectively.</p><p>Copper, the most ubiquitous industrial metal, also fell, losing nearly 1% and dipping to $2.17 per pound. The drop comes on slowing demand is one of the increasing signs that the global economy is faltering.</p>"

It is also assumed that the bank will restart its quantitative easing program of multi-million pound purchases of government bonds. The decision is expected in light of new indicators that the UK economy is on the edge of recession in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p><p>London's FTSE 100 is down ahead of the announcement, losing 0.17% in the last session. The CAC 40 also fell, by 0.16%, and the DAX posted a gain of 0.26% yesterday. The European markets are opening with modest gains in today's session.</p><p>Bank of Japan also increased stimulus policies recently, although less than expected. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 is up 1.08% and the TOPIX index has gained 0.93%. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, markets are also showing gains. The Hang Seng is up by 0.59%, and on mainland China the CSI 300 has gained 0.24%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX picked up 0.18%. It's interesting to note that the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates in its most recent policy decision.</p><p>Turning to the US markets, a rise in oil prices has helped to boost the major indexes by helping out the energy companies. The Dow Jones finished yesterday with a gain of 0.23%, the S&amp;P 500 picked up 0.31%, and the NASDAQ gained 0.43%.</p><p>Another bit of good news for the US markets came from the ADP payroll report. ADP, the largest private processor of payroll records, released its jobs numbers for July, showing that 179,000 jobs were created for the month. This was a decent print, but taken with the low GDP growth of the last two quarters, and the 140K jobs just needed to keep up with population growth, some analysts are saying that the ADP numbers show an economy treading water. In any case, the ADP print is seen as a preview of the monthly official non-farm payroll report, released by the Department of Labor. The July NFP will be released tomorrow.</p>"

The headline unemployment rate remained stable at 4.9% and the average hourly wage increased 0.3% &ndash; above the predicted 0.2%.</p><p>It was, for the most part, a good jobs report, and it increased expectations that the US Federal Reserve will initiate another interest rate hike before the end of the year. Odds for a December hike are set at 44%, while September, before the upcoming US election, has only a 15% chance of a Fed move.</p><p>The bullish sentiment sent US stock markets to record high level on Friday. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at new all-time highs of 2,182.87 and 5,221.12 respectively. It was a 0.86% gain for the S&amp;P and a 1.06% gain for the NASDAQ. The Dow closed with a respectable gain of 1.04%.</p><p>Data from Asia further underscores worries about the slowing global economic situation. Japan's current account balance for July came in at 1.65 trillion yen, about half of expectations, even though bank lending was up by 2.1%. China's trade balance beat expectations, with a $52.3 billion dollar surplus, but both exports and imports declined from last year. Exports were down 4.4% and imports down 12.5%, showing that China's trade surplus comes even as trade itself is declining.</p><p>By the numbers, the Asia-Pacific region markets took it all in stride. Equity markets followed Wall Street's Friday lead, and posted gains in today's session. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 2.44% and the TOPIX added 2.00%. In China, the CSI 300 advanced 0.91% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong picked up 1.43%. Australia's S&amp;P ASX increased by 0.74%.</p><p>Turning to Europe, we see inflation fears stating to dominate the economic landscape. Specifically, we see fears that inflation will continue to miss the European Central Bank's 2% target rate. The impact of the Brexit vote has been less than feared, so the issue comes down to growth, which has not been strong enough to create the price and wage pressures needed to generate the target inflation. In addition, the price of oil is falling again as we move toward the end of summer, which also tend to deflate prices.</p><p>With the ECB forecasting only a 0.6% increase in consumer prices, there is increasing speculation that Bank President Mario Draghi will be forced to increase the Eurozone's stimulus measures.</p><p>Traders don't appear to be worried, as European markets are off to a good opening today after a good session last Friday. In early trading so far, the FTSE 100 in London is up 0.42%, the DAX is up 0.72%, and the CAC 40 has increased 0.46%.</p>"

Much of the increase in production was to meet local summertime demand, as energy use in the Middle East increases with air conditioner use in the hot months.</p><p>The increases in supply and production are simply exacerbating the existing supply/demand imbalance in the global oil markets, and pushing prices down. Brent, the global benchmark price, is at $44.45 per barrel and US benchmark WTI, as mentioned above, is below $43 at $42.21 per barrel. Both prices are trending downwards.<br />Gold and other precious metals, in the meantime, are edging back up, buoyed by the weaker dollar and the reduced expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate move. The gloomy prospects for higher rates, coupled with a poor economic outlook globally, has investors moving back toward haven assets today.</p><p>The move pushed gold up about 1%, to $1,352.51 per ounce. Silver and platinum also gained, and are now selling at $20.33 and $1,183.18 per ounce respectively. Percentage wise, both white metals actually gained more than gold. Gold, however, is up 26% for the year to date, and its reputation as the traditional investing safe haven keeps it strong.</p><p>Industrial copper has also gained, improving more than half a percent to $2.17 per pound.</p>"

Stockpile inventories rose in the US, while the implications of increased Saudi production sank in with traders.</p><p>Data released by the US Energy Information Administration yesterday showed that oil stockpiles increased by 1.1 million barrels, beating the expectations. In addition, stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma tank farm, the nation's largest storage facility for crude oil, increased to 523.6 million barrels, a seasonal high level that has not been seen in 80 years.</p><p>Also, Saudi Arabia reported record setting oil production in July. Much of that is to meet local demand, as energy consumption in the Middle East is highest in the hot summer months &ndash; gotta have that air conditioning! &ndash; but the Kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter, and there is no doubt that much of that oil will end up on the markets.</p><p>Still, that would just add to the glut in global markets, and there are signs that demand is simply not meeting the supply. The same report that showed US stocks increasing also showed that US refineries were using 255,000 barrel per day less than the previous week, and that US imports fell by 334,000 barrels per day. These drops come at a time when US production is declining from its recent peaks. So there is an apparent slowing demand in the world's largest oil consumer, at the same time that global supply is increasing. It's not an environment conducive to higher prices.</p><p>And in fact, prices are down. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark price, is selling for just $41.51 per barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell below $44, and is now at $43.93.</p><p>Precious metals also fell overnight, although in this case the cause was profit taking after a sharp increase. Gold and silver both lost 0.15%, and platinum dipped 0.02%. All three metals remain at high levels, with gold selling for $1,344.56 per ounce, silver for $20.14, and platinum for $1,176.00.<br />Gold's current price puts it 27% higher for the year. Gold, and the other precious metals, have found support from a variety of fear factors in the markets including the low interest rates in the States, negative rates in Japan and several European countries, and anxiety over the UK's intention to exit the EU. All of this has boosted demand for haven assets. Look for gold to remain strong despite occasional price dips like today's.</p>"

The moves come as Saudi Arabia has been talking up the possibility of discussing production cutbacks &ndash; next month.</p><p>The OPEC nations are scheduled to hold an informal meeting in September, and the kingdom, the organization's largest oil producer and exporter, has signaled its willingness to talk about stabilizing the oil markets. That's a euphemism for boosting prices by cutting back on production. The drawback, of course, is that the Saudis need their current high production levels to maintain market share against rival oil giants Russia and Iran. Saudi Arabia, with its deep pockets and plentiful hard currency reserves, made the decision more than two years ago to keep production high and force prices low in an effort to harm the US shale producers (rivals in the oil business), Russian oil producers (more business rivals), and Iran (geopolitical foe that requires high oil prices to balance the budget). The irony, of course, is that their aggressive policy has gone on too long, and now the low prices are starting to sting the kingdom. In this environment, the Saudis are unlikely to do more than try and talk up prices, as they need their high production levels as much as they need higher sales prices.</p><p>That's not the only mixed signal in the oil markets. Worldwide, refiners are expected to bring their crude use to a record level of 80.6 million barrels per day this quarter, a quantity that may help absorb the record level production from OPEC. The US, however, is the world's largest consumer of crude oil, and stockpiles there &ndash; of crude and refined products like gasoline and diesel &ndash; are rising even as production is edging up. US refineries are entering their slowest production period of the year, when they shut for maintenance and then switch to producing winter blend gasolines.</p><p>Putting all of this into numbers gives us WTI, the US trading benchmark, at $44.66. Brent crude, the global benchmark price, is selling for $47.10. Both are starting to edge down, while remaining up from yesterday.</p><p>Oil isn't the only commodity whose price is moving around. Gold is up 27% for the year to date, but has started to lose steam. This month, the metal has lost about 1% as haven demand slowed after a strong US jobs report. Gold is currently selling for $1,340.55 per ounce. Other precious metals are also down from recent high levels, with silver selling for $19.90 and platinum for $1,129.60 per ounce. All three metals are up slightly from overnight lows.</p>"

Last week, the S&amp;P 500 set a new record, although it has eased back since and lost 0.08% in yesterday's trading. The Dow dipped 0.20%, while the NASDAQ managed a gain of 0.09%. Trading was downbeat, but rose in the latter half of the session and all three indexes finished on a rising trend.</p><p>The picture outside of the US isn't so good. Continued lagging economies and poor economic reports have prompted central banks to push further stimulus programs, but the results have been mixed so far.</p><p>The Bank of England raised rates last week, for the first time in seven years, and embarked on a bond-buying program of quantitative easing. They ran into a headwind &ndash; a lack of buyers on the first day. Since then, the Bank has been more successful with its stimulus, and the markets have responded. The FTSE 100 is up in early trading today, with a gain of 0.18%, the DAX is up 0.30%, and the CAC 40 has picked up a more modest 0.08%.</p><p>In Japan, the government is moving to enact a large economic stimulus while the central bank is under pressure to increase monetary easing and negative interest rates to fund the government initiative. At the same time, Q2 economic growth came in at just 0.2%, well below the 0.7% forecast.</p><p>Tokyo's markets were not impressed. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.30% and the TOPIX has lost 0.50% in today's session. These drops come as the yen is strengthened due to weakness in the US dollar. Japanese stocks frequently move in the opposite direction as the yen, as a stronger currency makes Japanese exports more expensive and the Japanese economy is exquisitely export-sensitive.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, stock were up. The Australian S&amp;P ASX is up 0.16%, Shanghai's CSI 300 is up 3.01%, and the Hang Seng is up 0.73%.</p>"

There's a lot of equivocation in that sentence, but oil traders are looking for any reason to hope the current low price regime may be drawing to a close.</p><p>Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer, jumped on the bandwagon, too, and hinted that it may go along with Saudi cuts. However, there are no signs that Iran has any plan to cut production; rather, Iran has signaled that it intends to keep increasing crude oil output now that international trade sanctions are lifted.</p><p>In addition to the confusing signals from major producers, market fundamentals of supply and demand still point to lower crude prices. Storage facilities worldwide are near maximum capacity, and demand is relatively weak in both the US and China, the world's largest oil consumers.</p><p>For the moment, though, crude prices are generally up. US benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate is trading at $45.36 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent is at $47.91. Both are trending down right now, on some mild profit taking as traders take advantage of these current prices.</p><p>In the precious metals markets, gold has made gains for two sessions now. The metal had fallen as investors moved toward riskier, higher returning assets, and took profits from the high prices in gold. With the gloomy data releases last week, and the Federal Reserve's policy position unclear, gold is now gaining again. The current price is $1,347.60 per ounce.</p><p>Silver and platinum are also both rising. Silver is now at $20 even, and platinum is selling for $1,123.27.</p><p>Iron ore, which had rallied strongly this year and is now priced at $60 per metric ton, may see a drop as we move toward Northern Hemisphere winter. The colder months typically see a slowdown in iron ore consumption in China, the world's largest user of the metal. With the seasonal slowdown approaching, some analysts see iron heading back to $40 per ton by year's end.</p>"

Last December, the Fed raised rates by 0.25%, in first such move in nine years and marking a change from monetary easing to monetary tightening. Since then, global economic conditions have been shaky and US economic data has been mixed, making the Fed reluctant to move. In last month's meeting, the central bank hinted that there may be an additional hike later this year.</p><p>Wednesday, investors will get a look into the Fed's mind when the minutes for that July meeting are released. Investors and market watchers will look closely to see the Fed's reasoning behind the decision. Additionally, Fed chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak on the 26th of this month at the Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her words will be carefully parsed.</p><p>Most countries are pursuing further easing policies, with some European central banks and the Bank of Japan pushing rates into negative territory. Should the Fed continue to advocate monetary tightening and higher rates, that will be an important divergence in bank policy from the other major economies. So far, futures markets are only putting a 40 to 45% chance of one hike by this year's end.</p><p>In the US markets, the main indexes all closed at record high levels yesterday. The Dow gained 0.32% to close at 18,636, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.28% and closed at 2,190.15, and the NASDAQ gained 0.56% for a 5,262.02 finish.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, stocks are not doing as well today. A slowdown in Japans economic growth &ndash; readings came in at 0.2%, well below the 0.7% forecast &ndash; combined with a planned government stimulus program of 28 trillion yen to fight price deflation, along with a stronger yen, have all pushed the Tokyo stock market down recently. The Nikkei 225 is down 1.62%, while the TOPIX index has lost 1.38%.</p><p>China's markets are also down, as weak economic data continues to spark concerns about the world's second largest economy.

In Australia, the S&amp;P ASX dipped 0.14%.</p><p>In Europe, markets finished mostly in the green yesterday. London's FTSE 100 gained 0.36%, and the DAX was up 0.24%.

The gain started when Saudi Arabia hinted that it would consider future production cuts at an informal OPEC meeting next month. Crude prices immediately jumped, as traders grasped at any chance for higher returns.</p><p>There's a question in this for oil traders: Why is the Saudi's statement pushing up oil prices?</p><p>The oil market fundaments &ndash; high production, soft demand, and overtaxed storage facilities &ndash; all point toward lower prices. A production cut by Saudi Arabia now will do nothing to alleviate that; the Kingdom is pumping oil at record levels &ndash; an estimated 10.9 million barrels per day this month, versus 10.67 million in July. Saudi Arabia chose to push production up and prices down two years ago, in a conscious effort to expand market share. The lower prices are hurting them, and talking up a cut is their way of trying to boost prices. It's not exactly a new trick, having been successfully applied this past April and June.</p><p>It's a question worth pondering as oil traders have to decide whether crude is really worth what they are paying. Brent is currently selling for $50.88 per barrel, and WTI, the US benchmark, stands at $48.52.</p><p>The US dollar was the only asset hit by the Fed's indecision. Gold has been pushed down by the possibility that the US central bank could raise rates. The metal rallied strongly in the first half of this year, but has slipped in recent trading sessions. It is now selling for $1,341.47 per ounce. Silver and platinum are also down, at $19.31 and $1,114.30 respectively.</p>"

Investors temporized unwilling to make significant moves before the Federal Reserve’s meeting at the end of the week, where new information about a rate increase is expected to be revealed. Falling oil prices also undermined investors’ enthusiasm and deflated their hopes that the crisis with oil oversupply can be diffused. Analysts claim that even if an agreement about the curtailment of oil production is achieved, this would prove to be counterproductive for OPEC, because the agreement might lead to further price gains and an increase of supply from other producers. Investors’ inactivity contributed to markets’ volatility. After having shuttled between gains and losses for the largest part of the trading day, stocks around the world eventually moved to the negative territory. Weakened by falling prices of copper and other metals, mining companies bore the brunt of losses. The US indices were mixed, The Dow Jones industrials declined 0.1%; the S&P lost as much.

Big banks - ANZ, Westpac, and Commonwealth &ndash; closed lower. Weakened by the falling yen, the Kospi shed 0.7%. The Sensex was 0.3% down.</p>"

Glencore revealed a 66% decline in first-half profit and, at present, is selling off its assets in order to pay its debts. The poor performance of the company dragged other miners into the negative territory. Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining slumped. Having reported low sales compared to the last year, Express also declined. Because its full year forecast was below expectations, TurboTax and QuickBooks also slid. Mylan, a global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company, lost 5.41% as a result of price increase for its EpiPen medicine that treats allergy. Other healthcare companies also suffered a drop as a corollary of Mylan’s retreat.</p><p>European Market. Banks had a good day jumping higher. Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole ended the day in the positive territory. Glencore is about to sell a 30% stake in the Ernest Henry copper-gold mine in Australia to Evolution Mining for A$880 million. Other miners and gold-miners - Randgold Resources, Fresnillo, Anglo American Antofagasta, and Rio Tinto – followed suit and decreased. Because it demonstrated a good pre-tax profit and increased revenues, WPP Group soared. Thanks to the upbeat new home sales reports received on Tuesday, homebuilding companies continued advancing. Persimmon, Berkeley Group, and Taylor Wimpey finished the day in the green.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Stocks were mixed here. The Shanghai Composite inched 0.1% lower, since monetary policy is, in all likelihood, not going to be eased by China’s Central Bank. The Hang Seng sank 0.8%. Thanks to the falling yen, the Nikkei climbed 0.6%. Nippon Electric Glass, Astellas Pharma, Advantest, and Dainippon Screen Manufacturing were up. Honda Motor, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota also appreciated. Fast Retailing again slid. In Australia, the S&P/ASX inched 0.1% higher. The All Ordinaries added as much. The big banks surged. Unlike mining companies in Europe, miners in the Asia-Pacific region added. BHP Billiton, South32, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue Metals Group finished the trading day higher. After having posted an excellent full year profit, Qantas Airways jumped. Because it showed a low full year profit, Boral, a building materials firm, slipped. The South Korean Kospi depreciated 0.3%.

In the US, trading was invigorated by highly positive consumer reports for July. The data showed that consumer spending, most essential for the economic development of the country, has steadily been growing for the last four months. And even though the same reports simultaneously pointed to an increase in the personal savings rate indicative of the possible reduction of consumer spending in future, investors considered the consumption data to be a good beginning of the third quarter. The US stocks jumped led by banks and other financial companies. Banks appreciated on Monday in the wake of the Fed Reserve’s intention to introduce a rate rise in September. All big banks -- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs - gained. The US indices finished the trading day in the green. The Dow Jones industries rose 0.6%. The S&P advanced 0.5%. The NASDAQ edged 0.3% higher. The European indices fared worse than their American counterparts. The CAC declined 0.4%. The DAX lost as much. The SMI edged 0.2% down.

Unlike banks in the US, banks in Europe were planted in the negative territory on Monday. Having agreed to sell its Argentinian subsidiary, Deutsche Bank slipped. Because its chairman was no longer at the supervisory board, Stada, a pharmaceutical company, decreased on Monday but gained 2.12% on early Tuesday. A signed contract with Amtrak to build new high-speed trains helped Alstom’s shares go higher. On Tuesday morning, Alstom was 0.10% up. Because its Zika virus test had been authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration, Roche Holdings advanced 0.33%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Thanks to Janet Yellen’s promise to introduce a rate increase this year and the Bank of Japan’s announcement that stimulus would be expanded, if needed, the dollar-yen pair strengthened. The Nikkei grew 2.3% pushed by the good performance of exporters. Canon, Honda Motor, Toyota, and Mazda Motor were among the winners on Monday. The S&P/ASX tumbled 0.8%. The All Ordinaries lost as much. Banks did as poorly in Asia as they did in Europe. Negatively influenced by sinking prices of gold, Newcrest Mining, Norther Star Resources, and Evolution Mining depreciated.

Both European and Asian markets were again mixed. As it has been the case almost for the whole month of August, trading was lacklustre. Suffering from falling oil prices, energy companies were again in decline. Chemical companies dropped equally low. Disheartened by lack of clarity surrounding a promised rates hike, investors lowered their activities at markets, refusing to make moves before the publication of the employment report on Friday. The persistent problem with oil oversupply continued driving everyone out of humour. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japanese stocks performed well lifted by the weakening yen and unexpectedly optimistic US consumer confidence data. Australian stocks, undermined by the rapid selling of resource shares, limited the upside, however, and pushed the whole market lower.  The Dow Jones industrials shed 0.3% on Wednesday afternoon and remained equally low on Thursday morning. The S&P dropped 0.2% on both days. The NASDAQ sank 0.2% on Wednesday but inched a bit higher on Thursday morning. In August overall, the Dow Jones lost 0.2%. The S&P was 0.1% lower. The NASDAQ was the only index that finished the month in the green, adding 1.0%. On Wednesday, the FTSE declined 0.6% but rallied on Thursday morning, adding 0.31%. The DAX slipped 0.6% on Wednesday but was 0.74% up in the morning on Thursday. The CAC first retreated 0.4% but rose 1.16% on Thursday. The SMI, likewise, had a 0.4% slide on Wednesday. For the whole month of August, the CAC remained virtually unchanged. The FTSE added 0.8%. The DAX jumped 2.5%. The SMI edged 0.9% higher in the last month of summer.</p>"

Having demonstrated low sales, Brown-Forman Corporation, an American company that produces spirits and wine, shed 3.54%. Thanks to the accumulation of crude oil stockpiles that already reached 2.3 million barrels this week, energy stocks tumbled. Chevron kept on dipping losing 1.10% on Wednesday. Exxon Mobil declined 0.43%. Schlumberger followed suit and finished the day 2.03% lower.</p><p>European Market. Due to falling prices of gold, mining stocks continue sinking, as did gold-mining companies. Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Fresnillo, Antofagasta, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Randgold Resources slipped. Banks were again in the green. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank did particularly well on Wednesday on rumours that they might merge. Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, and BNP Paribas also advanced. Barclays, HSBC Holdings, and Lloyds Banking Group soared bolstered by good reports on the healing British economy.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Property stocks jumped and brought the Shanghai Composite up 0.4%. Hang Seng, by contrast, shed 0.2%. In August, the former index was 3.6% higher. The latter advanced 5.0%. Helped by the weakened yen, the Nikkei rose 1.0% on Wednesday but was slightly lower on Thursday morning (up 0.23%). Exporters gained as they usually do, when the yen falls. Canon, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Mazda Motor finished the trading session in the positive territory. After the Nikkei had said that Google was going to make a deal with Japan’s largest bank to launch its digital wallet platform, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial soared. Australian indices were in trouble hit by the stronger dollar. Both the S&P/ASX and the All Ordinaries had a 0.8% slide. On Wednesday morning, the S&P/ASX gained a bit but not enough to move out of the negative sphere, being 0.32% lower. For the month of August, both S&P/ASX and the All Ordinaries decreased 2.0%. Even though iron prices started to recover from losses, mining companies retreated. BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals, and Rio Tinto tumbled. Gold-mining companies did too, negatively affected by low prices of gold. Newcrest Mining, Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, and Regis Resources slumbered. The Kospi ended the day 0.2% lower but appreciated 0.9% in August as a whole. The Sensex reached its highest level in more than a year, going 0.4% up on Wednesday.

Trajectories of global markets were different on Thursday. Starting lower, the US stocks managed to gather strength during the day and entered the positive territory by its closure. European stocks moved in a polar opposite direction, starting the day optimistically but declining as trading progressed, negatively influenced by a bad beginning of the trading day in the US. Like European market, the Asian stocks also finished mostly in the red, even though oil prices jumped in the region and China published the best CFLP manufacturing PMI in almost two years -- it jumped to 50.4. In the US, by contrast, manufacturing data was surprisingly poor. Manufacturing activities fell from 52.6 in July to 49.4 in August. Vehicle sales were also disappointing, having dropped from 17.9 million in July to 17.0 million in the last day of summer. Indices in the US inched slightly higher, with the Dow Jones industrial adding 0.1% and with the NASDAQ jumping 0.3%. The S&P did not change. Indices in Europe slid. The FTSE shed 0.5%. The DAX dropped 0.6%. The SMI dipped 0.7%. The CAC remained the same from the day before.

Although these two companies managed to rally on Friday, on Thursday, their shares significantly fell. Both of the companies reported weak sales in August. Salesforce.com boasted good profits but also slipped undermined by its third-quarter guidance. Energy stocks continued slipping, brought lower by falling oil prices. Only material companies were in the green, thereby reining in the market’s downward drifting. Because the Brazilian Oil company Petrobras had announced the premature termination of its contract with Diamond Offshore Drilling, the stocks of the latter sank. Thanks to its good second-quarter reports, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings appreciated. Charter Communications that had recently bought Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks also climbed.</p><p>European Market. After solid gains during the week, banks were mixed. Commerzbank continued appreciating. Deutsche Bank, by contrast, ended the day lower. Thanks to new complaints about its emission testing filed in Australia, Volkswagen lost on Thursday. E.ON dipped, and so did RWE. After it reported a 2.0% rise in full-year profit, Pernod Ricard added 1.57%. Technicolor also advanced. Having placed $650 million convertible bonds due 2023, Inmarsat climbed. Stocks of Hays retreated, after the company warned about the unstable condition of its UK and Irish markets. Low oil prices pulled Royal Dutch Shell and BP down.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. The Shanghai Composite shed 0.7% mainly due to the falling stocks of financial and property developers. The Hang Seng, by contrast, did well on Thursday, adding 0.8%. Thanks to the weak yen, the Nikkei rose, as always helped by exporters. Takeda Pharma, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Alps Electric soared. Just as they did in Europe, energy shares dipped also in the Asia-Pacific region. Inpex had a slide along with Japan Petroleum. Santos and Origin Energy finished in the negative territory as well. Australian indices tumbled. The S&P/ASX dropped 0.3%. The All Ordinaries lost as much. Mining companies retreated, just as energy shares did. Hit by iron ore prices that had sank to their four-week low, Rio Tinto slumped. Banks -- Westpac, NAB, and ANZ -- managed to reap gains. Woolworths also advanced. The Kospi edged 0.1% down. The Sensex was equally low.</p>"

Quite the contrary, the report showed that far less than expected jobs had been created at the job market in August. There was an addition of only 151,000 jobs, which is lesser than 275,000 jobs added in July. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%. Investors, however, shrugged the upsetting news off, explaining the insufficient growth of jobs as seasonally inevitable. August reports traditionally come out weaker than in other months. Poor employment reports failed to drive investors out of humour also because they are expected to prevent Federal Reserve policymakers from pushing rates higher in September. Investors’ nonchalant attitude to the bad job reports became more soar, however, at the beginning of the week, causing the dollar to plummet on Monday. All indices advanced on Friday. American indices appreciated 0.4% on Friday. Since the last week, the Dow Jones industrials soared 0.5%. The S&P also rose 0.5%. The NASDAQ was 0.6% higher for the week.

The Shanghai composite rose 0.1% on Friday and slipped 0.1% since the last week. The Hang Seng soared 0.5% on the day and 1.6% for the week. Although it did not change on Friday, shedding minor 1.16 points, the Nikkei was 3.5% higher on the week. Kansai Electric Power, Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Chugai Pharmaceutical, and J Front Retailing surged. Toshiba and Sony picked. Because their August sales fell below expectations, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor slipped. Tokyo Dome rose. Australian shares continued dipping. The S&P/ASX shed 0.8%. The All Ordinaries decreased 0.7%. From the last Friday, the S&P/ASX lost 2.6%. The All Ordinaries declined 2.4% for the week. The banks were lower, and so were Beach Energy and Woodside Petroleum. BHP Billiton moved into the positive territory, and so did Rio Tinto. Because gold climbed, gold mining companies -- Northern Star Resources, Newcrest, Regis Resources, and Evolution Mining -- surged. The Kospi edged 0.3% higher. The Sensex appreciated 0.4% on Friday.</p>"

The US and Asian markets finished the trading session planted in the positive territory, even though the US market vacillated between losses and gains throughout the day. European market was unfavourably influenced by early losses in America. ISM nonmanufacturing report that proved to be disappointing also put investors out of humour and tempered their trading enthusiasm. Investors’ initial optimism about the conversation between Russia and Saudi Arabia gave way to gloominess, once they realized that the two countries would not agree to curb oil production. During their meeting, Saudi Arabia said it sees no need to limit oil output; Russia agreed that a cap is not required. All talks about oil freeze seems to be pure eyewash: oil producing countries continue pumping with undiminished zeal. Iran is already moving closer to achieving the goal of pre-sanctions level production. Russia is producing more than 11 million barrels a day; OPEC countries together are giving 33.69 million barrels a day at present. Affected by the combination of these discouraging data, European stocks declined. The FTSE shed 0.8% on Tuesday afternoon and was 0.03% down in the morning on Wednesday. The CAC slipped 0.2% in the evening and 0.05% on Wednesday early morning. The SMI was down 0.1%. The DAX managed to finish 0.1% higher on Tuesday but decreased 0.02% in the morning on Wednesday.

After it agreed to purchase the molecular diagnostics company Cepheid for $4 billion, Danaher, an industrial and medical device company, soared, though it declined slightly on Wednesday.

Cummins, a corporation that designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products, lost 7.31%.</p><p>European Market. After it had agreed to purchase IDC Salud Holding S.L.U. for €5.76 billion, shares of Fresenius climbed. General Electric talked about buying Sweden's Arcam AB and Germany's SLM Solutions Group for $1.4 billion and immediately shed 0.77%. In the wake of the negotiations with General Electric, SLM was 1.49% lower on Wednesday. Arcam, by contrast, gained 2.11%. French airbus Group finished the day in the green, while Ingenico Group lost on Tuesday. The latter managed to rebound on Wednesday early morning, adding 0.31%. Aircraft companies did well in the UK. International Consolidated Airlines Group was higher, and so was EayJet. Redrow proposed a 67% growth in its full year dividend and advanced, dropping, however, 1.61% in the morning on Wednesday. Berkley Group counted gains. Standard Chartered along with Provident Financial finished the trading session in the negative territory.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market.

On Wednesday morning, however, when the yen rose to 114.16, the Japanese index slipped 0.41%.  Sumitomo Chemical, Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Nippon Suisan Kaisha, and Shiseido advanced on Tuesday, as did also Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Because the Reserve Bank of Australia had decided to keep its policy interest rate at 1.5%, the Australian indices tumbled. The S&P/ASX decreased 03%. The All Ordinaries lost as much. On Wednesday morning, however, the S&P/ASX inched 0.20% higher. Unlike European banks that sank, Australian banks were mixed. ANZ did not change much. Commonwealth rose 1.11%. Westpac was 1.62% higher. NAB edged 0.36% up on Wednesday morning. Mining companies – BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue Metal Group surged. The Kospi gained 0.3%.

Not expecting rates hike by Federal Reserve in September, investors worried about the economy and the earning power of companies. The Federal Reserve published its Beige Book ahead of its FOMC meeting on the 21st and the 22nd of September. The US economy’s growth was described in it as modest. Wage pressures for highly skilled workers were described as increased; the Beige Book also talked about the difficulty of filling job vacancies for technology specialists, engineers, and construction workers. Consumer spending remained unchanged.</p><p>The US market was brought low by weak data from supermarkets, consumer focused companies, and material companies. The only stocks that closed higher on Wednesday were energy ones, lifted by growing oil crude prices. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 0.1% on Wednesday and was 0.06% lower on Thursday morning. The S&P remained the same, losing 0.33 points on Wednesday and 0.01% early in the morning on Thursday. The NASDAQ was the only index that appreciated both on Wednesday and Thursday, adding 0.2% and 0.15% respectively.  European markets were pressurised by disappointing information about German industrial production. Yet having struggled in the morning, European markets managed to end the trading session in the green. The FTSE added 0.3% on Wednesday and 0.51% on Thursday morning. The DAX and CAC rose 0.6% on Wednesday. The former gained 0.22% and the latter rose 0.24% on Thursday in the morning. The SMI was 0.3% higher.   Asian market was mixed, weakened by volatile oil prices and the firmer yen.</p>"

What helped the US market keep a balance without sliding totally down were energy stocks that rose thanks to growing crude oil prices. After it said that it would drill crude oil in the field in Texas that had been recently discovered, Apache gained. Kroger declined 4.13%. Whole Food Markets slipped 5.28%. Sprouts Farmers Market lost whooping 13.72%. Having showed disappointing sales, Dave & Buster’s Entertainment dipped 2.9%. After Pershing Square had bought 9.9% stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant jumped. Seagate Technology and Western Digital finished the day in the positive territory. American airlines added along with Delta Airlines, United Continental Holdings, and Southwest Airlines. Apple had presented a new iPhone and soared.</p><p>European Market. Due to its negotiations with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile concerning the production of electric vehicles, Volkswagen rose. Other automakers – BMW and Daimler – followed suit and also appreciated. Having said that it had an increase in first-quarter pretax profit, Ashtead Group jumped. Foreseeing low profits this year, Sports Direct International declined. Barratt Developments did as well. Just Eat lost 0.65%. Thanks to growing oil prices, BP and Royal Dutch Shell closed higher. Influenced by investors’ worries about Brexit’s effects on the European economy, Berkley Group retreated.</p><p>Asian Market. The Shanghai Composite stayed the same, adding minor 1.22 points. The Hang Seng shed 0.2%, negatively affected by the report showing that China’s foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.19 trillion in August. Because the yen went up, the Nikkei slid 0.45%. For the same reason, exporters dropped. Sharp, Panasonic, and Mazda Motor drifted lower on Wednesday. Inpex, Fast Retailing, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial dipped. Rakuten, excited to join the Nikkei, soared.  In Australia, things looked up for indices. The S&P/ASX added 0.2%. The All Ordinaries advanced as much. The big four banks jumped. Wesfarmers gained, and so did Myer Holdings. Thanks to rising gold, goldminers -- Newcrest, Regis Resources, Evolution Mining, and Northern Star Resources – surged. Santos slipped, and so did Fortescue Metals Group. The Kospi shed 0.2%. The Sensex lost as much, prevented from bigger losses by the growing rupee.</p>"

Poor economic data from Germany, France, and China also weakened everyone’s optimism about the economic future of the world. North Korea’s statement that it had successfully tested nuclear warhead weighted heavily on investors’ minds, too, triggering geopolitical worries.

                            "text": "<p>US Markets. Utilities, phone companies, and real estate corporations were at the forefront of losing companies, pulled down by the announcements of probable rates hike in September. Negatively influenced by falling oil prices, oil and gas production companies slipped as well. Drilling companies retreated for the same reason. Diamond Offshore Drilling lost whooping 10.34%. The energy corporation, Williams Companies, shed 3.56%. Transocean, an offshore drilling constructor, sank 6.11%. Shares of SL Green Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust, dropped 4.79%. A&AT finished the trading day also lower, shedding 3.57%. Ventas followed suit and closed lower as well. Among these losers, only Restoration Hardware and Finisar advanced. The former soared 3.09%. Finisar, a manufacturer of optical communication components and subsystems, surged 12.79%.</p><p>European Markets. Due to rumours that it is about to close an agreement with the US Department of Justice to start an investigation of the sale of mortgage-backed securities, Deutsche Bank appreciated. Aiming to buy Monsanto, for which it would need to sell its dermatology business, Bayer, a German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company, had a 2.46% slide. Because it said it would want to buy 75% of Chesapeake’s shares in their shared Barnet Shale Company, Total lost 2.03%. British Burberry finished the trading session in the negative territory. Greene King was also in the red by the day’s closure. Having said that its fiscal pre-tax profit rose, pub chain JD Wetherspoon added on Friday but slid 4.12% on Monday morning. Banks had a good day on Friday: Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, and HSBC ended up in the green.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Region. China’s August consumer prices advanced 1.3% for the whole year but were lower than in July, when they advanced 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite lost 0.6 on Friday. Yet it was 0.4% higher since the last week. The Hang Seng advanced 0.8% on Friday and 3.6% on the week. The index, however, declined 2.93% on Monday morning. The Nikkei added insignificant 6.99 points on the day and advanced 0.2% since the last Friday. But it lost 1.73% on Monday in the morning. As was the case in Europe, telephone companies fared badly on Friday. NTT DoCoMo, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Kirin dipped. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Kobe Steel, Nippon Yusen KK, and J Front Retailing, by contrast, soared. In Australia, indices continued losing. The S&P/ASX shed 0.8% on Friday and 0.6% on the week. The All Ordinaries retreated as much on both occasions. Big banks sank. Even though oil prices went down, miners managed to keep in the positive territory on Friday, dropping low, however, in the morning on Monday. BHP Billiton slipped 4.04%. Rio Tinto edged 2.45% lower. Fortescue Metal Group plummeted 5.05%. The Bank of Korea continued having their interest at the lowest possible level of 1.25%, thereby negatively influencing the Kospi index. The announcement of North Korea about the successful trial of a miniaturised nuclear warhead also had a role in pushing the Kospi down. On Friday, the index sank 1.3%, remaining unchanged from the previous week. The Sensex dipped 0.9% on the day and was equally low since the last Friday.</p>"

The S&P 500 dropped to its lowest level since the 7th of July 2016, losing 1.48%. Treasuries also slid. Crude oil sank 3%, trading below US$45 a barrel, after the International Energy Agency had expressed an opinion that world stockpiles of oil will continue growing in 2017, for the fourth consecutive year. The International Energy Agency foresees that global demand for oil will be only 1.3 barrels a day, which is insufficient to solve the problem with oil glut. The gloomy outlook on oil oversupply immediately brought energy companies down. Banks and phone companies also sank, undermined by investors’ anxiety over rates increase.  The Dow Jones industrials shed 1.4%; the NASDAQ was 1.09% lower. The European indices shuttled between gains and losses during the day but were eventually weakened by the poor performance of the US stocks.

Investors curbed their activities in expectations of policy decisions from several banks forthcoming shortly. Today, the Bank of England is holding a meeting, during which it is expected to make no major changes to its current monetary policy. Investors believe that the Bank of England will continue pursuing monetary easing by maintaining its large asset purchase program and its low interest rates.  Investors’ other concern is the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, which will be announced next week. Everyone predicts that the Bank of Japan will increase negative interest rather than expand asset purchases. What, however, arouses investors’ keenest interest is the meeting of the Federal Reserve held next week. The question that has been bothering everyone since the last December is whether the Federal Reserve is going to push interest rates higher. Anxious about the Federal Reserve’s decision, investors refrained from making significant moves on Wednesday. Sliding oil prices also weighed on their sentiments as they watched shares of energy companies going lower. Investors’ worries were, however, tempered by good performance of technology stocks led by Apple that counterbalanced the US markets’ losses. The markets ended the trading session mixed, therefore: the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P slipped 1.18% and 0.06% respectively and the NASDAQ surged 0.36%.  In Europe, only the FTSE rose 0.12%; other indices dropped. The DAX lost 0.08%; the CAC retreated 0.39%; the SMI declined 0.1%. In Asia, most of the indices sank on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, however, the Hang Seng managed to add 0.86% and the S&P/ASX jumped 0.23% higher.</p>"

After Allergan had signed a takeover of Vitae Pharmaceuticals, the latter advanced whooping 157.41%. Having said that its third quarter profit would be smaller than expected, Nucor, an American producer of steel, dropped 1.46%. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store followed suit and also declined.

Mining companies appreciated: Glencore, Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, and Randgold Resources ended the day in the positive territory.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market.

The Deutsche Bank slipped 8.47% and brought the financial sector lower. As the S&P 500 declined 0.4%, the dollar surged, reaching its highest level since July.

Because its late-stage trial of an experimental glaucoma drug was successful, Aerie Pharmaceuticals closed higher. AMC Networks dipped.

                            "text": "<p>Global stocks were mostly higher on Monday morning, 19 September 2016. Spirits at markets soared thanks to a sudden jump of oil prices. Oil rose overnight more than 2% after Venezuela said that oil producing countries, those that belong to OPEC and those that do not, are approaching an agreement about oil production and its output. What investors feared yesterday, namely Libya’s and Nigeria’s vigorous re-entry into the oil market, stopped looking frightening on Monday morning. Renewed conflicts in these regions eloquently show that the flow of oil from these countries would be prevented and is not going to rattle the economic world as drastically as everyone feared. Investors are also looking forward to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Wednesday in hopes that it would substantially change its current monetary policy instead of pushing its rates further down the negative territory. Another event that fastened investors’ attention is the meeting of the Federal Reserve later this week. Although the meeting is eagerly awaited, not many people believe that the Federal Reserve policymakers are going to increase interest rates this time. The recent poll showed that economist estimate the probability of rates rise as one-in-four. Only 6% of economists expect the Federal Reserve to introduce changes. The majority of the people think that the Federal Reserve will wait with a rate hike until December, after the President Election has taken place. After losing badly last week, the majority of stocks climbed on Monday. The commodity-heavy FTSE added 1.27%. The French CAC was 1.30% higher. The DAX advanced 0.83%. Indices in the US also rallied. The Dow Jones Industrials appreciated 0.45%. The S&P 500 gained as much. The NASDAQ rose 0.47%. Asian indices did well, too, save the S&P/ASX that inched 0.04% lower. The Nikkei soared 0.70%.

As economists anticipated, the Federal Reserve did not rise rates. However much it praised the blossoming state of the economy, the Federal Reserve decided to wait for more signs of its strengthening, putting off a rates hike until December or, possibly, until the beginning of the next year. Whether the end of 2016 becomes the right time for rates increase will depend on how the economy, inflation, and markets fare before the presidential election in December. Meanwhile, rates range remains at 0.25% to 0.50%. The vote by FOMC members was 6 to 3. The Federal Reserve’s insistence on the same level of rates gave markets a substantial boost.  All indices, without exception, advanced on Wednesday and remained in positive territory on Thursday morning. The Dow Jones industrials climbed 0.90%. The S&P 500 was 1.09% higher. The NASDAQ appreciated 1.03%. The FTSE in the UK edged 0.40% up. The French CAC gained 0.89%. The DAX in Germany advanced 0.95%.

                            "text": "<p>Oil remains the major topic for discussion among economists. Its fluctuating prices influence investors’ mood and performance of stocks. On Monday morning, 26 September 2016, oil prices jumped but failed either to gladden investors or bring stocks higher. The reason for the advancement of oil prices stemmed from Saudi Arabia’s offer to cut oil production to January levels so that other countries could follow suit and, thereby, jointly achieve the resolution of the problem with oil glut. Although everyone’s immediate reaction to Saudi Arabia’s plan was renewed optimism over the solution of oil oversupply, reflected in the oil price, which climbed to US$44.84 on Monday morning, investors still understand that Saudi Arabia again might simply be trying to talk oil prices up to its advantage. They also suspect that the Saudis’ recent manoeuvre to advise Iran to curb its oil production in exchange for Saudi Arabia’s agreement to freeze its own is only an attempt to blame the Iranians for the lack of deal afterwards. After they have put blame at the door of the Persians, the Saudis will be able to propose conditions that would suit them the most. Investors are sceptical about the resolution of the problem with oil surplus also because oil is being produced now with increased zeal. More than 800,000 extra barrels per day are being delivered to the global market. Russia started to produce more oil; Libya and Nigeria are also restoring supply earlier disrupted by fighting in their regions.  Despite earlier forecasts that oil oversupply would be reduced in 2016, it will most probably continue being a pressing problem throughout 2017. With these gloomy conclusions on their minds, investors were not cheered up by today’s oil jump. Global stocks were deploringly down in the morning on Monday. Apart from the S&P/ASX that was flat in Australia, other indices dipped, with the Hang Seng leading losses. The Dow Jones sank 0.71%; the S&P 500 shed 0.57%; the NASDAQ declined 0.63%; the FTSE in the UK slipped 0.81%; the DAX dropped 0.92%; the CAC in France decreased 1.10%. Asian stocks tumbled by the most in two weeks, sharing the lowest position with the Indian Sensex. The Hang Seng lost 1.53%. Because the yen added 0.2% on Monday, the Nikkei declined 1.25%.</p>"

Although the majority of people disbelieve that oil surplus can be resolved, a hope was given yesterday by Saudi Arabia that hinted at possible compromise with Iran. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister expressed an opinion that Iran, Libya, and Nigeria should be allowed to produce oil at the maximum reasonable level. The only fly in the ointment offered by the Saudis was their conviction that no compromise will be achieved this time in the Algerian capital. Iranian Oil Minister seconded Saudi Arabia’s opinion by saying that reaching agreement at OPEC talks is not on his country’s immediate agenda. According to the two countries, the earliest when agreement between oil producers might be negotiated is November. Supported by this news, markets rose. European stocks were helped by commodity producers that saved them from a monthly decline. On Wednesday, European market managed to recover from a selloff on Monday, on which banks tumbled. All European banks were in the green today in the morning. Deutsche Bank agreed to sell its UK insurance unit Abbey Life Assurance Co. for 935 million pounds and advanced 3.3%. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, revived by corporate news, moved 1% upwards. Asian markets fared worse than European ones. Futures on Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.4%. Contracts in South Korea, Hong Kong, and Australia slipped around 0.1%. American indices advanced, by contrast, with the Dow Jones, the S&P, and the NASDAQ appreciating 0.74%, 0.64%, and 0.92% respectively.</p>"

At the end of Tuesday, the S&P advanced 0.64% to 2,159.93. Its quarterly gain is thus estimated at 2.9%. The best performer was Amazon that rose 2.12% and thereby hit a record high. Tech stocks also did well, led by Alphabet that was 1.01% up. IBM also appreciated. AutoZone added 2.73%. Other winners were Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Southwest Airlines, and Expedia. After American Express was cleared of violation of antitrust laws charges, it climbed 1.36%. American Express also promised to buy back 150 million shares of its stock. Netflix did well, too, soaring 2.65%. Energy stocks kept the market’s upward movement in check, however: Devon energy shed 3.18%; Halliburton sank 1.04%. Having expressed willingness to purchase Vantage Energy with its debt, Rice Energy slipped. Chesapeake Energy followed suit and also closed in the red.</p><p>European Market. European market recovered from Monday’s drop. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index managed to rally after the past decline and added 0.1%. The major reason for the market’s advancement came from European banks’ ability to pare their losses. Pulled down earlier by a 14 million fine, Deutsche Bank appreciated 3.3%. What helped it to rise was its decision to sell its UK insurance unit Abbey Life Assurance Co. Having agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle National Credit Union Administration claims that it sold faulty securities to US credit unions, Royal Bank of Scotland edged 1.00% up. TUI rose its annual forecast and immediately soared 2.4%. Because Deutsche Post said it would by UK. Mail Group Plc for 242 million pounds, the latter jumped whooping 43%. After admitting that English people started using busses much less than in previous years, Stagecoach Group Plc shed 1.9%. Miners were firmly in the positive territory. Glencore was 0.54% higher. Shares of BHP Billiton surged 1.58%. Rio Tinto also gained along with Anglo American.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Indices in Asia did worse than their European and American peers. Even though the yen remained little changed, the Nikkei in Japan dipped 1.31%. The Shanghai Composite added 0.6%. The Hang Seng slid 0.15% on Wednesday morning, even though it ended in the positive territory on Tuesday afternoon. Automakers and other exporters sank on Wednesday. Canon lost 0.97%. Honda Motors had a 1.08% slide. Mazda shed 1.66%. Toyota depreciated 1.13%. Unlike European banks, banks in Asia -- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Mizuho Financial, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial – all drifted lower. In Australia, the S&P/ASX inched 0.12% higher. Pessimistic about the outcome of OPEC’s meeting today in Algeria, oil stocks moved into negative sphere. Woodside Petroleum slumped 0.67%. Santos dropped 3.12%. Contracts on stock gauges in North Korea, Hong Kong, and Australia sank 0.1%.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Wednesday, 29 September 2016, was the day that uncorked a surprise on the world. Despite expectations of the contrary outcome of OPEC talks, Saudi Arabia suddenly called for cutting oil production yesterday in Algeria. The kingdom’s volte-face was unexpected, since together with Iran, it had repeatedly hinted that no deal concerning oil production was likely. The agreement to curb crude output happens first time since 2008 and is motivated, on Saudi Arabia’s part, by the country’s weakened financial situation.  Saudi Arabia boasts the highest budget deficit among the world’s twenty biggest economies. According to economical predictions, the kingdom will face about 13.5% deficit of gross domestic products in 2017. Its economic growth will be only 1%, in contrast to, say, the economic growth of its regional rival, Iran, whose economic jump this year is estimated as high as 4%.  Anxious about its economy, Saudi Arabia hopes, therefore, that a small reduction of oil output will bring higher oil prices and higher revenues and will thus pay off. Although the deal will be discussed only in November and might prove to be less promising than it appears now, at first blush, global markets rejoiced on the news from the capital of Algeria. Oil prices immediately increased 0.2%, reaching US$47.13 a barrel. This is the biggest jump of oil prices since April. Energy stocks also went up, climbing almost 4% in Asia, and brought all markets higher. Global indices were in the green on Wednesday and Thursday morning. The Dow Jones Industrials added 0.61%; the S&P advanced 0.53%; the NASDAQ closed yesterday 0.24% higher. The FTSE soared 1.02%; the German DAX surged 1.07% higher; the CAC in France advanced 1.41%. Because the yen tumbled 1%, the Nikkei rose 1.39%; the Hang Seng was 0.43% up; the S&P appreciated 1.09%.</p>"

The new data showed that trade deficit rose from $39.5 billion in July to $40.7 billion in August. Factory orders were slightly higher – 0.2% - in August. September ISM nonmanufacturing index was 57.1, which is significantly higher than in August, when it was 51.4%. This is the record of 11 months.</p><p>European Market. Air Berlin added 4.03%, after it agreed to talk over the transferal of its tourist business to a new airline group that will be built in future. Commerzbank continued losing, being 0.64% lower on Thursday. After it had been allowed to take control of Groupama Banque, Orange decreased in Paris. Air Liquide also closed lower. SFR finished firmly in the negative territory. In the UK, Tesco sank 1.64%, even though a day before the retailer posted positive half year sales results and gave a good full year prognosis. After saying that it would sell 50% of its investment portfolio in order to maximize returns for shareholders, SVG Capital lost 0.60%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Topix in Japan advanced 0.5%, boosted by good performance of Toyota Motor Corporation extended its gains for the fourth day, adding 0.73%. The Hang Seng hit its highest level in four weeks. Helped by the weakened yen and rallying exporting companies, the Nikkei edged 0.5% higher. As is always the case when the yen goes down, exporters Panasonic, Canon, Toyota Motor, Honda, and Nissan Motor moved to positive territory. Hitachi also closed higher. Samsung Electronics appreciated 4.45%. Sompo Holdings also increased 6.49%. Asahi Group Holdings retreated 0.43%. In Australia, new economic data was worrisome. Australian service sector was down for the second month, signalling that the Australian economy is in trouble. Other data were more cheerful. Australian retail sales reached a seven-month high. Because of the continual fall of oil prices, gold mining companies slid. Newcrest Mining, Evolution, OceanaGold, Northern Star Resources, and Saint Barbara plunged. Miners followed suit. Rio Tinto were down on Wednesday but rallied on Thursday afternoon. Energy stocks and banks closed mixed. The S&P/ASX was down 0.57% on Thursday. The Kospi lost 0.1%; the Sensex shed 0.4%.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>In Europe, markets on Monday, 10 October 2016, moved mostly to the downside, although some stocks kept steady. Investors refrained from active trading, upset by yesterday disappointing job reports and a decline of oil prices. The US Labour Department announced yesterday that instead of expected 175,000 jobs, there were only 156,000 jobs added in September. To make matters worse, the lion share of newly created jobs are low-paid and belong mostly to clerical and social services sectors. The unemployment rate remained roughly the same as it was in August – 5%. The Federal Reserve, however, still holds an upbeat view of the global economy and seems determined to increase interest rates before the end of the year. Another factor contributing to European stocks’ downside movement was price of oil that slid, because everyone feels sceptical about a resolution of oil glut problem. OPEC hopes that by November 30, all its member will agree on an output reduction, which is proposed to be between 32.50 million and 33.0 million barrels a day. At the moment, OPEC produces 33.6 million barrels a day. Agreeing on oil cut is not an easy feat to achieve, considering all countries’ self-serving interests and political antagonism between some of them. Dropping oil prices negatively influenced energy companies across Europe, which contributed to the markets’ general retreat. The majority of European indices thus depreciated. The EURO STOXX 50 shed 0.24%. France’s CAC slipped 0.67%. The DAX in Germany decreased 0.67%. The FTSE was the only index that finished planted in positive territory, rising 0.63%, because it heavily depends on commodities. Boosted by higher metal prices, mining companies performed well and helped the FTSE index in London climb. Stocks in the Asia-Pacific region fared better than markets in Europe. Chinese markets gained, despite a 2% drop in the property sector. The Australian stocks also jumped, pushed upwards by Telecom Services, Metals and Mining companies, and higher prices of gold. The S&P/ASX finished 0.15% higher. The US markets are closed on Monday in honour of Columbus Day holiday. Markets in Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan are also shut.</p>"

Banks also did poorly and dragged other financial shares down with themselves. BNP Paribas closed 0.89% lower. Societe Generale also retreated 1.06%. Even though it continues actively negotiating the price of the fine with the Department of Justice, Deutsche Bank plummeted. The troublesome Commerzbank also slid 2.02%.  Italian and Spanish banks followed suit and moved into negative territory. Equally poorly banks did in the UK. Only HSBC appreciated on Monday. Other Banks – the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking, and Barclays – depreciated 1.62%, 1.68%, and 2.07% respectively. Severely criticised by investors, E.ON slumped 0.46%. After the renewables unit, Innogy, appeared at markets on Friday, RWE dropped. Miners and Gold Mining companies in London rose helped by higher metal prices. Glencore, Fresnillo, and Randgold Resources finished in the green. The first gained 0.50%; the second added 1.80%, and the third was 1.84% higher.  After having cancelled all its flights to and from Greece, in the aftermath of which thousands of passengers remained stuck in airports, EasyJet tumbled 2.03%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market. Indian market celebrated advancement of the majority of its stocks. Metal producing companies rose and positively affected Indian market overall. National Aluminium rose 6.72%. Hindalco was 1.96% higher. What else helped the market soar is the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy revealed last week. Contrary to everyone’s expectations, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates to a five-year low. Monthly inflation data arriving on Thursday and Friday is also expected to give a boost to the Sensex. The Sensex reined in its three day retreat and edged 0.4% up. Foreign investors continue contributing to Indian market’s wellbeing. Stocks in Australia managed to close higher, even those some companies sank on Monday. Thanks to the growth of gold and other metals, mining and gold mining companies rallied. BT advanced 7.66%. Resolute Mining jumped 5.20%. Syrah Res F closed the trading day 5.14% higher. Independence Group, an Australian mining company, did badly, by contrast, shedding 4.98%. Infigen Energy experienced a 4.22% slide. Advancing Telecoms Services, however, which rose 1.05%, helped the market stay in positive territory.  The Nikkei were 0.23% down. The Hang Seng also slipped 0.42%.</p>"

It maintained that America had slow but definitely steady economic growth from August and October.  A labour market is defined as “tight”; growth of salaries is described as “modest.” According to the Beige Book, inflation in the US is mild, retail sales are higher, and consumer spending is mixed. Energy was also characterised positively. In addition, the Beige Book praised the expansion of real estate and the improvement of commercial activities in the country. The bright picture the Beige Book presented to investors cheered them up and brought the majority of stocks higher. Oil eased slightly on profit taking but still was high, as was gold that dipped in comparison to its Wednesday price but remained at a two-week highs on Thursday morning. Both commodities positively influenced the activities at markets around the globe. European market was mixed, weakened by the FTSE’s slide. American and Asian markets, by contrast, were in the positive territory. The Dow Jones rose 0.22%. The S&P 500 was equally high. The NASDAQ edged 0.05% higher. The DAX advanced 0.21%. The CAC inched 0.07% up. Because shares of Travis Perkins that announced the liquidation of nearly 600 jobs in 30 branches tumbled 2.46%, the FTSE ended in the red. Asian markets rose. Metals and Mining companies pushed Australian stocks higher, even though the Australian dollar lost 0.5% against the US dollar, after data had shown that employment in Australia decreased by 9,800 in September.

American Express, by contrast, published its worst quarterly revenue in five years, pulled down by the loss of its contract with Costco Wholesale. After its stocks slipped on Wednesday, the company managed to move into positive territory, adding 1.95% on Thursday morning. Ebay posted a 5.6% increase in quarterly revenue, which rose from $2.10 billion to $2.22 billion. Its shares advanced 2.78% on Thursday. Energy stocks did well. Transocean, Halliburton, Newfield Exploration, Noble Energy, Chesapeake Energy, and Occidental Petroleum were higher. Not sounding upbeat about its current situation, Intel tumbled 5.93%. After it had reduced its revenue forecast, Manhattan Associates plunged whooping 10.43%.  Because of continuous poor sales, Cree decreased 11.07%. Also performing badly, Reynolds American closed 2.07% lower.</p><p>European Market. Investors were focused on the European Central Bank’s announcement, though they expected its monetary policy to remain almost certainly unchanged. At the center of their attention was Mario Draghi’s speech, from which investors hoped to glean information concerning the bank’s next policy moves. Financial companies were in the green on Thursday. BNP Paribas edged 0.26%. German Banks – Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank – added 0.34%. Deutsche Lufthansa increased its profit target for the year and soared 2.45%. Having announced that its sales decreased 0.4%, Publicis Groupe shed 4.98%.  Stocks in London were also mostly in the red, brought lower by Travis Perkins. The supplier of building materials revealed its plan to close down more than 30 of its branches that would entail the liquidation of more than 600 jobs.

BHP Billiton was 0.86% higher. Rio Tinto jumped 0.94%.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Market.  Asian stocks closed higher. The MSCI Asia Pacific added 0.5%, helped by energy shares that overall increased 1.7%. Topix in Japan rose 0.8%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong appreciated 0.33%.  Bolstered by good performance of Real Estate, Banking, and Transportation Equipment companies, Japan market finished higher on Thursday. The Nikkei was 1.39% up, as the session ended, and thus reached a three-months high. Mitsui Fudosan was the best performer at the Nikkei, advancing 4.85%. Tokyo Tatemono increased 4.65%. Because two US companies decided to sell portions of their businesses to Terumo, the latter jumped. Hitachi slipped. Australian markets were planted in positive territory. The greatest news was the merger of Australia’s biggest gambling businesses -- Tabcorp Holdings and Tatts Group. Thanks to high prices of gold, gold miners Newcrest Mining and Evolution Mining surged. Due to high oil prices and hopes that OPEC countries would curtail their oil production, Woodside Petroleum, Santos, and Oil Search ended the trading day in the green.</p>"

Pessimism about the resolution of oil glut problem strengthened among analysts and investors. All these factors conspired to bring oil prices down. Oil sank to a tree-week lows. WTI shed 1.02% to reach US$49.45. Brent Crude declined 0.77% to trade at US$50.40. Because the greenback eased slightly and investors turned their attention to the safe haven, gold jumped to a three-weeks high. It added 0.11% and traded at US$1.275.26. And yet, the outlook for gold prices remains gloomy. Despite its current growth, gold is not expected to rise for long, because there is a strong likelihood that the Federal Reserve will increase rates before the end of the year. Other precious metals were also in positive territory. Silver added 0.25% to US$17.85. Platinum advanced 0.44% to reach US$968.98. Base metals fared worse. Copper futures slipped 0.28% to US$2.13.</p>"

What, however, enlivened markets on Thursday, the 27th of October 2016, was the publication of several economic reports arriving from the US. Initial jobless claims this week experienced a decline from the last week’s 261,000 to 258,000. Durable goods orders in September shed 0.1%. The pending home sales index rose by 1.5% to 110.0 in September from 108.4 in August. Economic data coming from the UK also affected investors’ mood, since it showed that the country’s economy grew faster than anyone anticipated, which suggested that interest rates’ decrease in 2017 is highly unlikely. On this news, treasury yields hit its highest level since May. The dollar also advanced against all its major counterparts. Oil rose slightly from a three-week low, because the Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries spoke in favour of curbing oil production. Calling on OPEC members to be flexible, the Saudi Arabia promised to reduce its peak oil output by 4%. Although the Saudi Arabia’s pledge immediately influenced oil prices for the better, it is unclear whether cutting of the Kingdom’s oil production by 4% would make a difference for the elimination of oil glut. Despite the Saudi Arabia’s hopefulness, scepticism still prevails among analysts doubtful that OPEC will ever find a solution to the problem with oil oversupply. Reacting to this news, global markets were mixed on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. The US market was mostly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrials shed 0.16%. The S&P 500 edged 0.30% lower; the NASDAQ sank 0.65%. European stocks advanced overall on Thursday, helped by the strong report on the UK gross domestic product, even though poor Chinese data and mixed earning reports checked in markets’ advance further. On Thursday afternoon, The FTSE rose 0.4%; the DAX was 0.1% higher; and the CAC added minor 1.02 points. The SMI also closed 0.4% higher. On Friday morning, however, European markets moved to negative territory. The FTSE opened 0.24% lower; the DAX lost 0.53%; the CAC slid 0.03%. Asian markets fared better on Friday and ended the trading day mixed. Japan markets advanced pushed higher by the good performance of Finance and Investment, Textile, and Marine Transport sectors. The Nikkei jumped 0.63%. The Hang Seng slumped 0.77%. Australian shares suffered losses due to the decline of the A-REITs, Industrials, and Consumer Staples sectors. At the close, the S&P/ASX dipped 0.22% and thereby hit a one month low. Two days meeting of OPEC members is starting today. Iraq is still insisting on being exempt from oil production freeze and cuts, because it says it needs oil revenue to fight against ISIS. Libya and Nigeria also asked not to be given a pumping quota. Among invited countries, Norway excused itself and said it would not come to the meeting.</p>"

Both events heightened investors’ uncertainty about the winner of the Presidential Elections and the resolution of oil glut problem. Another piece of news came out on Friday and was more cheerful: the first estimate of third quarter growth. GDP was higher 2.9% after it had grown 1.4% in the second quarter. Last time when the growth of GDP was that high was in the last quarter of 2014. Consumer sentiment index reading for October was 87.2, which is a decline from September’s final reading of 91.2. With investors disturbed by the FBI’s investigations and OPEC’s inability to make a progress in talks, European market slid on Monday. The FTSE shed 0.33%; the DAX retreated 0.34%; the CAC sank 0.53%. Shipbuilding, Steel, and Mining sectors pushed Japanese market lower. The Nikkei was 0.12% down. The Hang Seng inched 0.09% lower. Australian stocks were the only stocks in the Asia-Pacific region that appreciated on Monday boosted by the good performance of the Gold, Steel, and Mining sectors. The S&P/ASX rose 0.64%. The US stocked closed in the red on Friday but advanced slightly at the beginning of the day on Monday, after investors started coming to terms with the news about the renewed probe into Clinton’s email. On this news, oil prices fell. Gold jumped 0.6% on Friday and stayed more or less at this level on Monday, as investors turned to it as safe haven in times of troubles.</p>"

Base metals did well in Asia. Strong domestic demand, high coal prices, and logistical issues pushed prices of aluminium and zinc up. Aluminium surged by 10% last week and thereby reached the highest level since September. Zinc also surged to the level it occupied last time in March. Copper shed 0.30% to US$2.18.</p>"
